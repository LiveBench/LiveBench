We say that a collection $C$ of identical dominoes is a maximal grid-aligned configuration on the board if $C$ consists of $(n^2-1)/2$ dominoes where each domino covers exactly two neighboring squares and the dominoes don't overlap: $C$ then covers all but one square on the board. We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nWe claim the answer is $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ .\n\nFirst, consider a checkerboard tiling of the board with 4 colors: R, G, B, Y. Number each column from $1$ to $n$ from left to right and each row from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom. We color a tile R if its row and column are odd, a tile G is its row is even but its column is odd, a tile B if its row and column is even, and a tile Y if its row is odd but its column is even.\n\nLemma 1: Throughout our moves, the color of the uncolored tile stays an invariant.\n\nConsider that a domino can either only change rows or can only change columns. Therefore, sliding a domino into the hole and creating a new one has two possible colors. Of these, note that the new hole will always trivially be two tiles away from the old hole, meaning that the parity of both the row and column number stays the same. Thus, the lemma holds.\n\nLemma 2: There are more red tiles than any other color. Because each color is uniquely defined by the parity of a pair of column and row number, it satisfies to show that given an odd integer $n$ , there are more odd positive integers less than or equal to $n$ than even ones. Obviously, this is true, and so red will have more tiles than any other color.\n\nLemma 3: For any starting configuration $C$ and any blank tile $B$ such that the blank tile's color matches the blank tile's color of $C$ , there is no more than one unique configuration $C'$ that can be produced from $C$ using valid moves.\n\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists two different $C'$ . We can get from one of these $C'$ to another using moves. However, we have to finish off with the same hole as before. Before the last move, the hole must be two tiles away from the starting hole. However, because the domino we used to move into the blank tile's spot is in the way, that hole must be congruent to the hole produced after the first move. We can induct this logic, and because there is a limited amount of tiles with the same color, eventually we will run out of tiles to apply this to. Therefore, having two distinct $C'$ with the same starting hole $B$ is impossible with some $C$ .\n\nWe will now prove that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the answer. There are $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ rows and $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ columns that are odd, and thus there are $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ red tiles. Given lemma 3, this is our upper bound for a maximum. To establish that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is indeed possible, we construct such a $C$ :\n\nIn the first column, leave the first tile up blank. Then, continuously fill in vertically oriented dominos in that column until it reaches the bottom. In the next <missing 1> columns, place <missing 2> vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top. At the bottom row, starting with the first unfilled tile on the left, place horizontally aligned dominos in a row until you reach the right.\n\nObviously, the top left tile is red. It suffices to show that any red tile may be uncovered. For the first column, one may slide some dominos on the first column until the desired tile is uncovered. For the bottom row, all the first dominos may be slid up, and then the bottom dominos may be slid to the left until the desired red tile is uncovered. Finally, for the rest of the red tiles, the bottom red tile in the same color may be revealed, and then vertically aligned dominos in the same column may be slid down until the desired tile is revealed. Therefore, this configuration may produce $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ different configurations with moves.\n\nHence, we have proved that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the maximum, and we are done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> n-1 \n<expression 2> \\frac{n-1}{2} \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "1,2", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> n-1 \n<expression 2> \\frac{n-1}{2} \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nA positive integer $a$ is selected, and some positive integers are written on a board. Alice and Bob play the following game. On Alice's turn, she must replace some integer $n$ on the board with $n+a$, and on Bob's turn he must replace some even integer $n$ on the board with $n/2$. Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n\nAfter analyzing the integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nThe contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever). So we want to prove that, if the game can potentially last indefinitely, then Alice can force it to last indefinitely. Clearly, if there is $1$ number on the board initially, all moves are forced. This means the claim is true in this specific case, because if the game \"potentially\" can last forever, this means it must last forever, since the game can only be played in one way. Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n\n\nCase 1: $v_2 (a)=0$ The game lasts forever here no matter what. This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$ , Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$ , Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number n on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$ , meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when $v_2 (a)=0$ , so we're done.\n\n\nCase 2: <missing 1> If there is at least one number n on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=1$ . This way, the new number <missing 2> satisfies $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . If Bob does divides $n'$ until $v_2 (n)=1$ , Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\nIf there is no even number on the board, then the game can clearly not last forever. No matter what Alice does, Bob will have no even number to divide after her move.\n\n\nGeneral Case: <missing 3> In general, it seems to be the case that the game can last indefinitely for some given $a$ if and only if there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , so we should aim to prove this.\n\n1. \"If\"\n\nAlice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ . If she does this addition, then $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ , keeping an even number on the board. Even if Bob divides $n'$ until $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ , Alice will apply the same strategy and keep $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ . Alice's use of this strategy ensures that there always exists some number n on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , ensuring there always exists an even number n on the board.\n\n2.\"Only If\"\n\nIf <missing 4> for all n on the board, this means that Alice can never change the value of $v_2 (n)$ for any $n$ on the board. Only Bob can do this, and Bob will subtract $1$ from each $v_2 (n)$ until they are all equal to $0$ (all odd), ending the game.\n\nWe've shown that the game can last indefinitely iff there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , and have shown that Alice can ensure the game lasts forever in these scenarios using the above strategy. This proves the contrapositive, proving the claim.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> n'= n+a \n<expression 2> v_2 (a)=x \n<expression 3> v_2 (n) < v_2 (a) \n<expression 4> v_2 (a)=1 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "4,1,2,3", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> n'= n+a \n<expression 2> v_2 (a)=x \n<expression 3> v_2 (n) < v_2 (a) \n<expression 4> v_2 (a)=1 \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

We can also see that <missing 3> does not work because the terms <missing 4> , and $24$ are consecutive factors of <missing 5> .

Also, <missing 13> is a factor of $n!$ . Since <missing 14> for all $n\\geq7$ , we can use Bertrand's Postulate to show that there is at least one prime number $p$ such that <missing 15> . Since we have two consecutive factors of $n!$ and a prime number between the smaller of these factors and $n$ , the condition will not be satisfied for all odd $n\\geq7$ .\n\nIf $n\\geq8$ is even, then <missing 16> is a factor of $n!$ .

For each non-empty $T \\subseteq \\{S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_{100}\\}$, the size of the intersection of the sets in $T$ is a multiple of $|T|$. What is the smallest possible number of elements which are in at least 50 sets?\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is <missing 1> .  We encode with binary strings <missing 2> of length 100. Write <missing 3> if $w$ has 1's in every component $v$ does, and let $|v|$ denote the number of 1's in $v$ . Then for each $v$ , we let $f(v)$ denote the number of elements <missing 4> such that <missing 5> . So the problem condition means that $f(v)$ translates to the statement <missing 6> for any <missing 7> , plus one extra condition <missing 8> . And the objective function is to minimize the quantity <missing 9> . So the problem is transformed into a system of equations over <missing 10> . Note already that it suffices to assign $f(v)$ for $|v| \\geq 50$ , then we can always arbitrarily assign values of $f(v)$ for $|v| < 50$ by downwards induction on $|v|$ to satisfy the divisibility condition (without changing $M$ ). Thus for the rest of the solution, we altogether ignore $f(v)$ for $|v| < 50$ and only consider $P(u)$ for <missing 11> . Now consider the construction: <missing 12> This construction is valid since if <missing 13> for <missing 14> then <missing 15>  <missing 16> is indeed a multiple of <missing 17> , hence $P(u)$ is true. In that case, the objective function is <missing 18> as needed.\n\n\u00b6 Proof of bound. We are going to use a smoothing argument: if we have a general working assignment $f$ , we will mold it into <missing 19> . We define a push-down on $v$ as the following operation: Pick any $v$ such that $|v| \\geq 50$ and <missing 20> .  Decrease $f(v)$ by $|v|$ .  For every $w$ such that <missing 21> and <missing 22> , increase <missing 23> by 1.  Claim \u2014 Apply a push-down preserves the main divisibility condition. Moreover, it doesn't change $A$ unless $|v| = 50$ , where it decreases $A$ by 50 instead.  Proof. The statement $P(u)$ is only affected when <missing 24> : to be precise, one term on the right-hand side of $P(u)$ decreases by $|v|$ , while <missing 25> terms increase by 1, for a net change of <missing 26> . So $P(u)$ still holds.  To see $A$ doesn't change for <missing 27> , note $|v|$ terms increase by 1 while one term decreases by <missing 28> . When $|v| = 50$ , only $f(v)$ decreases by 50.\u25a1\nNow, given a valid assignment, we can modify it as follows: First apply pushdowns on <missing 29> until $f(1\\ldots1) = 100$ ; Then we may apply pushdowns on each $v$ with <missing 30> until <missing 31> ; Then we may apply pushdowns on each $v$ with <missing 32> until <missing 33> ; ...and so on, until we have <missing 34> for $|v| = 50$ .  Hence we get $f(1\\ldots1) = 100$ and <missing 35> for all <missing 36> . However, by downwards induction on <missing 37> , we also have <missing 38> since <missing 39> and $f(v)$ are both strictly less than $|v|$ . So in fact <missing 40> , and we're done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> f = f_0 \n<expression 2> P(u): |u| \\texttt{ divides } \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f(v) \n<expression 3> |w| = |v| - 1 \n<expression 4> f_0 \n<expression 5> x\\in S_i \\iff v_i = 1 \n<expression 6> v \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{100} \n<expression 7> f_0(v) = 2|v| - 100. \n<expression 8> = (100 - k) \\cdot 2^k = |u| \\cdot 2^k \n<expression 9> v \\subseteq w \n<expression 10> u \\neq 0, \\dots 0 \n<expression 11> 50 \\leq |v| \\leq 100 \n<expression 12> 1\\ldots1 \n<expression 13> f_0(v) \n<expression 14> |v| = 99, 98, \\ldots, 50 \n<expression 15> |v| - |u| \n<expression 16> u \\subseteq v \n<expression 17> A = \\sum_{i=50}^{100} \\binom{100}{i}(2i - 100) = 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 18> f(w) \n<expression 19> |v| > 50 \n<expression 20> -|v| \n<expression 21> \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f_0(v) = \\binom{k}{0} \\cdot 100 + \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot 98 + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot 96 + \\cdots + \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot (100 - 2k) \n<expression 22> f(v) < 99 \n<expression 23> A := \\sum_{|v| \\geq 50} f(v) \n<expression 24> |u| \\geq 50 \n<expression 25> w \\subseteq v \n<expression 26> f(v) < 98 \n<expression 27> 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 28> f(1\\dots 1) > 0 \n<expression 29> f(v) \\equiv f_0(v) \\pmod{|v|} \\implies f(v) = f_0(v) \n<expression 30> x\\in \\bigcup S_i \n<expression 31> |v| = 99 \n<expression 32> 0 \\leq f(v) < |v| \n<expression 33> |u| = 100 - k \n<expression 34> k \\leq 50 \n<expression 35> |u| \n<expression 36> |v| = 98 \n<expression 37> f(v) \\geq |v| \n<expression 38> mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} \n<expression 39> f(v) < 50 \n<expression 40> -|u| \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "27,6,9,30,5,2,10,28,23,38,24,7,33,34,21,8,35,17,4,37,25,3,18,16,15,40,19,20,12,31,22,36,26,39,32,11,14,29,13,1", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> f = f_0 \n<expression 2> P(u): |u| \\texttt{ divides } \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f(v) \n<expression 3> |w| = |v| - 1 \n<expression 4> f_0 \n<expression 5> x\\in S_i \\iff v_i = 1 \n<expression 6> v \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{100} \n<expression 7> f_0(v) = 2|v| - 100. \n<expression 8> = (100 - k) \\cdot 2^k = |u| \\cdot 2^k \n<expression 9> v \\subseteq w \n<expression 10> u \\neq 0, \\dots 0 \n<expression 11> 50 \\leq |v| \\leq 100 \n<expression 12> 1\\ldots1 \n<expression 13> f_0(v) \n<expression 14> |v| = 99, 98, \\ldots, 50 \n<expression 15> |v| - |u| \n<expression 16> u \\subseteq v \n<expression 17> A = \\sum_{i=50}^{100} \\binom{100}{i}(2i - 100) = 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 18> f(w) \n<expression 19> |v| > 50 \n<expression 20> -|v| \n<expression 21> \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f_0(v) = \\binom{k}{0} \\cdot 100 + \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot 98 + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot 96 + \\cdots + \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot (100 - 2k) \n<expression 22> f(v) < 99 \n<expression 23> A := \\sum_{|v| \\geq 50} f(v) \n<expression 24> |u| \\geq 50 \n<expression 25> w \\subseteq v \n<expression 26> f(v) < 98 \n<expression 27> 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 28> f(1\\dots 1) > 0 \n<expression 29> f(v) \\equiv f_0(v) \\pmod{|v|} \\implies f(v) = f_0(v) \n<expression 30> x\\in \\bigcup S_i \n<expression 31> |v| = 99 \n<expression 32> 0 \\leq f(v) < |v| \n<expression 33> |u| = 100 - k \n<expression 34> k \\leq 50 \n<expression 35> |u| \n<expression 36> |v| = 98 \n<expression 37> f(v) \\geq |v| \n<expression 38> mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} \n<expression 39> f(v) < 50 \n<expression 40> -|u| \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

Apply complex shoelace to the triangles with vertices <missing 7> to get <missing 8> which equals the above. \u25a1\n\nConstruction: It suffices to actually just take all the diagonals from the vertex 1, and then color the triangles with the $m$ colors in cyclic order. To see this works one can just do the shoelace calculation: for a given residue <missing 9> , we get an area <missing 10>  <missing 11>  <missing 12>  <missing 13> .  (We allow degenerate triangles where <missing 14> with area zero.) However, if $m$ is a proper divisor of $n$ , then <missing 15> . Similarly, <missing 16> . So the inner sum vanishes, and the total area of the $m$ -th color equals <missing 17> which does not depend on the residue $r$ , proving the coloring works. \u00b6 Proof of necessity. It's obvious that <missing 18> (in fact <missing 19> ). So we focus on just showing <missing 20> .  Repeating the same calculation as above, we find that if there was a valid triangulation and coloring, the total area of each color would equal <missing 21> .  However: Claim \u2014 The number <missing 22> is not an algebraic integer when <missing 23> .  Proof. This is easiest to see if one knows the advanced result that <missing 24> is a number field whose ring of integers is known to be <missing 25> . Hence if one takes <missing 26> as a <missing 27> -basis of $K$ , then <missing 28> is the subset where each coefficient is integer. \u25a1 However, each of the quantities <missing 29> is <missing 30> times an algebraic integer. Since a finite sum of algebraic integers is also an algebraic integer, such areas can never sum to $S$ .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> K := \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega) \n<expression 2> (\\omega^{-1}, \\omega^0, \\omega^1, \\ldots, \\omega^{n-2}) \n<expression 3> 1, \\omega^a, \\omega^b \n<expression 4> \\frac{n}{m} \\frac{(\\omega - 1)(\\omega^{-1} + 1)}{2i} \n<expression 5> = \\frac{\\omega - 1}{2i} \\left(\\frac{n}{m}(1 + \\omega^{-1}) + \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} (\\omega^{-j} - \\omega^j)\\right) \n<expression 6> T(a,b) \n<expression 7> 1, \\omega, \\ldots, \\omega^{n-1} \n<expression 8> \\frac{1}{2i} \\det \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \\omega^a & \\omega^{-a} & 1 \\ \\omega^b & \\omega^{-b} & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2i} \\det \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \\omega^a - 1 & \\omega^{-a} - 1 & 1 \\ \\omega^b - 1 & \\omega^{-b} - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \n<expression 9> = \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} \\frac{(\\omega^{-j} - 1)(\\omega^1 - 1)(\\omega^j - \\omega^{-1})}{2i} \n<expression 10> \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} \\omega^j = \\omega^r(1 + \\omega^m + \\omega^{2m} + \\cdots + \\omega^{n-m}) = 0 \n<expression 11> = \\frac{\\omega - 1}{2i} \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} (\\omega^{-j} - 1)(\\omega^j - \\omega^{-1}) \n<expression 12> m | n \n<expression 13> m < n \n<expression 14> \\omega^{-k} \n<expression 15> \\omega^k, \\omega^{k+a}, \\omega^{k+b} \n<expression 16> \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} \\text{Area}(\\omega^j, \\omega^0, \\omega^{j+1}) = \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} T(-j, 1) \n<expression 17> \\mathcal{O}_K \n<expression 18> m \\leq n - 2 \n<expression 19> \\mathbb{Q} \n<expression 20> S := \\frac{n}{m} \\frac{(\\omega - 1)(\\omega^{-1} + 1)}{2i} \n<expression 21> \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} \\omega^{-j} = 0 \n<expression 22> m \\nmid n \n<expression 23> \\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega] \n<expression 24> T(a,b) := \\frac{(\\omega^a - 1)(\\omega^b - 1)(\\omega^{-a} - \\omega^{-b})}{2i} \n<expression 25> 2i \\cdot S \n<expression 26> r \\mod m \n<expression 27> k = 0 \n<expression 28> j \\in {-1,0} \n<expression 29> \\frac{1}{2i} \n<expression 30> \\omega = \\exp(2\\pi i/n) \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "30,7,15,24,14,27,3,8,26,16,9,11,5,28,10,21,4,13,18,12,20,25,22,1,23,2,19,17,6,29", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> K := \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega) \n<expression 2> (\\omega^{-1}, \\omega^0, \\omega^1, \\ldots, \\omega^{n-2}) \n<expression 3> 1, \\omega^a, \\omega^b \n<expression 4> \\frac{n}{m} \\frac{(\\omega - 1)(\\omega^{-1} + 1)}{2i} \n<expression 5> = \\frac{\\omega - 1}{2i} \\left(\\frac{n}{m}(1 + \\omega^{-1}) + \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} (\\omega^{-j} - \\omega^j)\\right) \n<expression 6> T(a,b) \n<expression 7> 1, \\omega, \\ldots, \\omega^{n-1} \n<expression 8> \\frac{1}{2i} \\det \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \\omega^a & \\omega^{-a} & 1 \\ \\omega^b & \\omega^{-b} & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2i} \\det \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \\omega^a - 1 & \\omega^{-a} - 1 & 1 \\ \\omega^b - 1 & \\omega^{-b} - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \n<expression 9> = \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} \\frac{(\\omega^{-j} - 1)(\\omega^1 - 1)(\\omega^j - \\omega^{-1})}{2i} \n<expression 10> \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} \\omega^j = \\omega^r(1 + \\omega^m + \\omega^{2m} + \\cdots + \\omega^{n-m}) = 0 \n<expression 11> = \\frac{\\omega - 1}{2i} \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} (\\omega^{-j} - 1)(\\omega^j - \\omega^{-1}) \n<expression 12> m | n \n<expression 13> m < n \n<expression 14> \\omega^{-k} \n<expression 15> \\omega^k, \\omega^{k+a}, \\omega^{k+b} \n<expression 16> \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} \\text{Area}(\\omega^j, \\omega^0, \\omega^{j+1}) = \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} T(-j, 1) \n<expression 17> \\mathcal{O}_K \n<expression 18> m \\leq n - 2 \n<expression 19> \\mathbb{Q} \n<expression 20> S := \\frac{n}{m} \\frac{(\\omega - 1)(\\omega^{-1} + 1)}{2i} \n<expression 21> \\sum_{j \\equiv r \\mod m} \\omega^{-j} = 0 \n<expression 22> m \\nmid n \n<expression 23> \\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega] \n<expression 24> T(a,b) := \\frac{(\\omega^a - 1)(\\omega^b - 1)(\\omega^{-a} - \\omega^{-b})}{2i} \n<expression 25> 2i \\cdot S \n<expression 26> r \\mod m \n<expression 27> k = 0 \n<expression 28> j \\in {-1,0} \n<expression 29> \\frac{1}{2i} \n<expression 30> \\omega = \\exp(2\\pi i/n) \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

It turned out that no matter how the necklace was cut into $m$ blocks of $n$ consecutive beads, each block had a distinct number of red beads. Determine, with proof, all possible values of the ordered pair $(m, n)$\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is <missing 1> only.  Proof the task requires $m \\le n+1$ . Each of the $m$ blocks has a red bead count between $0$ and $n$ , each of which appears at most once, so $m \\le n+1$ is needed.  Construction when <missing 2> . For concreteness, here is the construction for <missing 3> , which obviously generalizes. The beads are listed in reading order as an array with <missing 4> rows and $n$ columns. Four of the blue beads have been labeled <missing 5> , \\dots, <missing 6> to make them easier to track as they move. <missing 7> To prove this construction works, it suffices to consider the $n$ cuts <missing 8> , <missing 9> , <missing 10> , \\dots, <missing 11> made where $T_i$ differs from <missing 12> by having the cuts one bead later also have the property each row has a distinct red count: <missing 13> We can construct a table showing for each <missing 14> the number of red beads which are in the <missing 15> st row of $T_i$ from the bottom: <missing 16> This suggests following explicit formula for the entry of the <missing 17> th cell which can then be checked straightforwardly: <missing 18> And one can see for each $i$ , the counts are all distinct (they are <missing 19> from bottom to top). This completes the construction.  Construction when <missing 20> . Fix $m$ . Take the construction for <missing 21> and add $n+1-m$ cyan beads to the start of each row; for example, if <missing 22> and <missing 23> then the new construction is <missing 24> This construction still works for the same reason (the cyan beads do nothing for the first $n+1-m$ shifts, then one reduces to the previous case). If we treat cyan as a shade of blue, this finishes the problem.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> \\begin{array}{c|cccc} k & T_0 & T_1 & T_2 & T_3 \\ \\hline k=4 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 \\ k=3 & 3 & 3 & 3

For example, if your answer starts as 5, 22, 3, ..., then that means expression 5 fills <missing 1>, expression 22 fills <missing 2>, and expression 3 fills <missing 3>. Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nLet $n > 2$ be an integer and let $\\ell \\in \\{1, 2,\\dots, n\\}$. A collection $A_1,\\dots,A_k$ of (not necessarily distinct) subsets of $\\{1, 2,\\dots, n\\}$ is called $\\ell$-large if $|A_i| \\ge \\ell$ for all $1 \\le i \\le k$. Find, in terms of $n$ and $\\ell$, the largest real number $c$ such that the inequality \n $  \\sum_{i=1}^k\\sum_{j=1}^k x_ix_j\\frac{|A_i\\cap A_j|^2}{|A_i|\\cdot|A_j|}\\ge c\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i\\right)^2 $ \n holds for all positive integer $k$, all nonnegative real numbers $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_k$, and all $\\ell$-large collections $A_1,A_2,\\dots,A_k$ of subsets of $\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$.\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer turns out to be <missing 1> .  \u00b6 Rewriting the sum. Abbreviate <missing 2> , and WLOG assume <missing 3> . To prove the bound, we first rewrite the left-hand side using indicator functions and switch the order of summation as <missing 4>  <missing 5>  <missing 6> .  Hence, if we define the <missing 7> variables <missing 8> for each <missing 9> then the previous expression simplifies to just <missing 10> \u00b6 Proof of bound. We split the sum into $p = q$ versus $p \\neq q$ and bound by QM-AM separately in the obvious way. For the terms $p = q$ , <missing 11>  <missing 12> . When $p \\neq q$ we instead have <missing 13>  <missing 14> .  Combining the two bounds gives <missing 15> which matches the answer claimed above.  \u00b6 Construction. Equality occurs if <missing 16> is the same for all $p$ and <missing 17> is the same for all $p \\neq q$ , and <missing 18> for all $i$ . This occurs if one takes, say, <missing 19> and <missing 20> to be all the subsets of size <missing 21> each exactly once.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> \\ell \n<expression 2> \\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]} v_{p,q} = \\sum_{i=1}^k 2\\binom{|A_i|}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} = \\sum_{i=1}^k (|A_i| - 1)x_i \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^k (\\ell - 1)x_i = \\ell - 1 \n<expression 3> v_{p,p} \n<expression 4> v_{p,q} := \\sum_{i:p,q\\in A_i} \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} \n<expression 5> = \\sum_{p\\in[n]} \\sum_{q\\in[n]} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{x_i\\mathbf{1}{p\\in A_i}}{|A_i|} \\cdot \\frac{x_j\\mathbf{1}{q\\in A_j}}{|A_j|} \n<expression 6> LHS = \\sum_{p\\in[n]} \\sum_{q\\in[n]} v_{p,q}^2 \n<expression 7> v_{p,q} \n<expression 8> c = \\frac{n + \\ell^2 - 2\\ell}{n(n-1)} \n<expression 9> \\sum_{p\\in[n]} v_{p,p} = \\sum_{i=1}^k |A_i| \\cdot \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} = \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = 1 \n<expression 10> \\implies \\sum_{p\\in[n]} v_{p,p}^2 \\geq \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{p\\in[n]} v_{p,p}\\right)^2}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} \n<expression 11> LHS = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} \\frac{x_j}{|A_j|} |A_i \\cap A_j|^2 \n<expression 12> (p,q) \\in [n]^2 \n<expression 13> A_i \n<expression 14> LHS \\geq \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(\\ell-1)^2}{n(n-1)} = \\frac{n + \\ell^2 - 2\\ell}{n(n-1)} \n<expression 15> |A_i| = \\ell \n<expression 16> \\sum x_i = 1 \n<expression 17> [n] := {1,\\ldots,n} \n<expression 18> k = \\binom{n}{\\ell} \n<expression 19> n^2 \n<expression 20> = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} \\frac{x_j}{|A_j|} \\left(\\sum_{p\\in[n]} \\sum_{q\\in[n]} \\mathbf{1}{p\\in A_i}\\mathbf{1}{q\\in A_j}\\right) \n<expression 21> \\implies \\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]} v_{p,q}^2 \\geq \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]} v_{p,q}\\right)^2}{n(n-1)} \\geq \\frac{(\\ell-1)^2}{n(n-1)} \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "8,17,16,11,20,5,19,4,12,6,9,10,2,21,14,3,7,15,18,13,1", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> \\ell \n<expression 2> \\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]} v_{p,q} = \\sum_{i=1}^k 2\\binom{|A_i|}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} = \\sum_{i=1}^k (|A_i| - 1)x_i \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^k (\\ell - 1)x_i = \\ell - 1 \n<expression 3> v_{p,p} \n<expression 4> v_{p,q} := \\sum_{i:p,q\\in A_i} \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} \n<expression 5> = \\sum_{p\\in[n]} \\sum_{q\\in[n]} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{x_i\\mathbf{1}{p\\in A_i}}{|A_i|} \\cdot \\frac{x_j\\mathbf{1}{q\\in A_j}}{|A_j|} \n<expression 6> LHS = \\sum_{p\\in[n]} \\sum_{q\\in[n]} v_{p,q}^2 \n<expression 7> v_{p,q} \n<expression 8> c = \\frac{n + \\ell^2 - 2\\ell}{n(n-1)} \n<expression 9> \\sum_{p\\in[n]} v_{p,p} = \\sum_{i=1}^k |A_i| \\cdot \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} = \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = 1 \n<expression 10> \\implies \\sum_{p\\in[n]} v_{p,p}^2 \\geq \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{p\\in[n]} v_{p,p}\\right)^2}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} \n<expression 11> LHS = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} \\frac{x_j}{|A_j|} |A_i \\cap A_j|^2 \n<expression 12> (p,q) \\in [n]^2 \n<expression 13> A_i \n<expression 14> LHS \\geq \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(\\ell-1)^2}{n(n-1)} = \\frac{n + \\ell^2 - 2\\ell}{n(n-1)} \n<expression 15> |A_i| = \\ell \n<expression 16> \\sum x_i = 1 \n<expression 17> [n] := {1,\\ldots,n} \n<expression 18> k = \\binom{n}{\\ell} \n<expression 19> n^2 \n<expression 20> = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^k \\frac{x_i}{|A_i|} \\frac{x_j}{|A_j|} \\left(\\sum_{p\\in[n]} \\sum_{q\\in[n]} \\mathbf{1}{p\\in A_i}\\mathbf{1}{q\\in A_j}\\right) \n<expression 21> \\implies \\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]} v_{p,q}^2 \\geq \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]} v_{p,q}\\right)^2}{n(n-1)} \\geq \\frac{(\\ell-1)^2}{n(n-1)} \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

Then the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$ .\n\nTo prove this claim, note that $p$ is the smallest prime that divides $n$ , so it is the smallest divisor not equal to $1$ , meaning the first $2$ divisors are $1$ and $p$ . Furthermore, the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$ (i.e. not equal to <missing 2> is equal to $q$ . This is because all other divisors either include a prime $z$ different from both $q$ and $p$ , which is larger than $q$ (since $q$ and $p$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$ ), or don\u2019t include a different prime $z$ . In the first case, since <missing 3> , the divisor is larger than $q$ . In the second case, all divisors divisible by <missing 4> are also larger than $q$ , and otherwise are of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ or $p^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$ . If the divisor is of the form $p^x$ , then it is a power of $p$ . If it is of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ , the smallest of these factors is <missing 5> . Therefore, (in the case where $2$ or more primes divide $n$ ) the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$ , since after each divisor $p^x$ , the next smallest divisor is either <missing 6> or simply $q$ .\n\nIf <missing 7> , the condition fails. This is because <missing 8> , since <missing 9> is divisible by <missing 10> , but $q$ is not since it is a prime different from $p$ . If $a=1$ , then <missing 11> , which does divide $q$ . Therefore $a$ must equal $1$ for the condition to be satisfied in this case. However, we know that the ordered list of divisors satisfies <missing 12> , meaning since the first $3$ divisors are <missing 13> , then the last $3$ divisors are <missing 14> , so <missing 15> must divide <missing 16> . But <missing 17> is divisible by $p$ , so <missing 18> must also be divisible by $p$ , but since $a=1$  <missing 19> is and $n$ isn't.\n\nWhen <missing 20> , it is easy to verify this works for all primes $p$ and all <missing 21> , since <missing 22> , and the divisors are ordered as <missing 23> .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> \\frac{n}{q} \n<expression 2> (\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n) \n<expression 3> z>q \n<expression 4> p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2} \n<expression 5> d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n \n<expression 6> (\\frac{n}{q}) \n<expression 7> q^2 \n<expression 8> p^a \n<expression 9> {1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x} \n<expression 10> x\\geq 2 \n<expression 11> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n<expression 12> a\\geq 2 \n<expression 13> n=p^x \n<expression 14> \\frac{n}{p} + n \n<expression 15> p^{a-1}=p^0=1 \n<expression 16> p<q \n<expression 17> \\frac{n}{p} \n<expression 18> p^{x+1} \n<expression 19> p^{a-1} \n<expression 20> (1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots) \n<expression 21> p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q \n<expression 22> p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q \n<expression 23> (1, p, q) \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "16,20,3,7,21,18,12,22,8,19,15,5,23,2,6,11,1,14,17,13,10,4,9", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> \\frac{n}{q} \n<expression 2> (\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n) \n<expression 3> z>q \n<expression 4> p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2} \n<expression 5> d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n \n<expression 6> (\\frac{n}{q}) \n<expression 7> q^2 \n<expression 8> p^a \n<expression 9> {1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x} \n<expression 10> x\\geq 2 \n<expression 11> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n<expression 12> a\\geq 2 \n<expression 13> n=p^x \n<expression 14> \\frac{n}{p} + n \n<expression 15> p^{a-1}=p^0=1 \n<expression 16> p<q \n<expression 17> \\frac{n}{p} \n<expression 18> p^{x+1} \n<expression 19> p^{a-1} \n<expression 20> (1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots) \n<expression 21> p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q \n<expression 22> p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q \n<expression 23> (1, p, q) \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nFor each integer $k \\geqslant 2$, determine all infinite sequences of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots$ for which there exists a polynomial $P$ of the form $P(x)=x^k+c_{k-1} x^{k-1}+\\cdots+c_1 x+c_0$, where $c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_{k-1}$ are non-negative integers, such that\\[P\\left(a_n\\right)=a_{n+1} a_{n+2} \\cdots a_{n+k}\\]for every integer $n \\geqslant 1$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nLet $f(n)$ and $g(j)$ be functions of positive integers $n$ and $j$ respectively.\n\nLet $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$ , then <missing 1> , and <missing 2> Let <missing 3> If we want the coefficients of <missing 4> to be positive, then <missing 5> for all $j$ which will give the following value for $P$ : <missing 6> Thus for every $j$ and $n$ we need the following: <missing 7> Solving for $g(j)$ we get: <missing 8>  <missing 9> for all $n$ and $j$ because $g(j)$ needs to be greater than or equal to zero for all coefficients to be non-negative.\n\nThis means that $f(n)$ needs to be increasing with $n$ , or staying constant, and also with $f(1)=0$ because <missing 10> .\n\nIn addition, since we need all coefficients to be integer, then all $f(n)$ and $g(j)$ must also be integers. We also need $g(j)$ to not be dependent of $n$ , so in the expression <missing 11> , the $n$ needs to cancel. This mean that the rate of change for $f(n)$ with respect to $n$ needs to be constant. This can only be achieved with $f(n)$ be the equation of a line with slope being either zero or positive integer.\n\nSo, we set $f(n)$ to be the equation of a line as <missing 12> with $m$ being the slope with a non-negative value and with $b$ the intercept at <missing 13> . We know that $f(1)=0$ so <missing 14> which means that <missing 15> and our function becomes <missing 16> .

(Note that $[z]$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$. For example, $[-\\pi] = -4$ and $[2] = [2.9] = 2$.)\n\nThe solution is:\nAnswer: \n All even integers satisfy the condition of the problem and no other real number $\\alpha$ does so.  \n Solution 1. \n First we will show that even integers satisfy the condition. If <missing 1> where $m$ is an integer then <missing 2> which is a multiple of $n$ .  Now we will show that they are the only real numbers satisfying the conditions of the problem. Let <missing 3> where $k$ is an integer and $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Then the number <missing 4>  <missing 5> has to be a multiple of $n$ . We consider two cases based on the parity of $k$ .  \n Case 1: $k$ is even. \n Then <missing 6> is always a multiple of $n$ . Thus <missing 7> also has to be a multiple of $n$ .  We will prove that $[n\\epsilon] = 0$ for every positive integer $n$ by strong induction. The base case $n = 1$ follows from the fact that $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Let us suppose that <missing 8> for every $1 \\leq m < n$ . Then the number <missing 9> has to be a multiple of $n$ . As $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ then $0 \\leq n\\epsilon < n$ , which means that the number <missing 10> has to be equal to 0.  The equality $[n\\epsilon] = 0$ implies <missing 11> . Since this has to happen for all $n$ , we conclude that <missing 12> and then $\\alpha$ is an even integer. Case 2: $k$ is odd. \n We will prove that $[n\\epsilon] = n - 1$ for every natural number $n$ by strong induction. The base case $n = 1$ again follows from the fact that $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Let us suppose that <missing 13> for every $1 \\leq m < n$ . We need the number <missing 14>  <missing 15>  <missing 16> to be a multiple of $n$ . As $k$ is odd, we need <missing 17> to be a multiple of $n$ . Again, as $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ then $0 \\leq n\\epsilon < n$ , so $[n\\epsilon] = n - 1$ as we wanted.  This implies that <missing 18> for all $n$ which is absurd. So there are no other solutions in this case.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> = \\frac{kn(n + 1)}{2} + [\\epsilon] + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 2> \\frac{kn(n + 1)}{2} + [\\epsilon] + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + [n\\epsilon] = \\frac{kn(n + 1)}{2} + 0 + 1 + \\cdots + (n - 2) + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 3> 1 + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 4> \\alpha = k + \\epsilon \n<expression 5> |\\alpha| + |2\\alpha| + \\cdots + |n\\alpha| = k + [\\epsilon] + 2k + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + nk + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 6> \\alpha = 2m \n<expression 7> 1 - \\frac{1}{n} \\leq \\epsilon < 1 \n<expression 8> [\\epsilon] + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 9> = \\frac{k + 1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{k - 3}{2}n + 1 + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 10> |\\alpha| + |2\\alpha| + \\cdots + |n\\alpha| = 2m + 4m + \\cdots + 2mn = mn(n + 1) \n<expression 11> \\epsilon = 0 \n<expression 12> [m\\epsilon] = m - 1 \n<expression 13> [\\epsilon] + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + [n\\epsilon] = [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 14> [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 15> \\frac{kn(n+1)}{2} \n<expression 16> 0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1/n \n<expression 17> = \\frac{kn(n + 1)}{2} + \\frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2} + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 18> [m\\epsilon] = 0 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "6,10,4,5,1,15,8,18,13,14,16,11,12,2,17,9,3,7", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> = \\frac{kn(n + 1)}{2} + [\\epsilon] + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 2> \\frac{kn(n + 1)}{2} + [\\epsilon] + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + [n\\epsilon] = \\frac{kn(n + 1)}{2} + 0 + 1 + \\cdots + (n - 2) + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 3> 1 + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 4> \\alpha = k + \\epsilon \n<expression 5> |\\alpha| + |2\\alpha| + \\cdots + |n\\alpha| = k + [\\epsilon] + 2k + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + nk + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 6> \\alpha = 2m \n<expression 7> 1 - \\frac{1}{n} \\leq \\epsilon < 1 \n<expression 8> [\\epsilon] + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 9> = \\frac{k + 1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{k - 3}{2}n + 1 + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 10> |\\alpha| + |2\\alpha| + \\cdots + |n\\alpha| = 2m + 4m + \\cdots + 2mn = mn(n + 1) \n<expression 11> \\epsilon = 0 \n<expression 12> [m\\epsilon] = m - 1 \n<expression 13> [\\epsilon] + [2\\epsilon] + \\cdots + [n\\epsilon] = [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 14> [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 15> \\frac{kn(n+1)}{2} \n<expression 16> 0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1/n \n<expression 17> = \\frac{kn(n + 1)}{2} + \\frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2} + [n\\epsilon] \n<expression 18> [m\\epsilon] = 0 \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

(Note that $\\gcd(x,y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of integers $x$ and $y$.)\n\nThe solution is:\nAnswer: \n The only solution is $(a,b) = (1,1)$ .  \n Solution 1. \n It is clear that we may take <missing 1> for $(a,b) = (1,1)$ .

You are also given a list of formulae in latex in the format \"<expression Y> = $<latex code>$\" where Y is the identifier for the formula. Your task is to match the formulae to the missing tags in the solution. Think step by step out loud as to what the answer should be. If you are not sure, give your best guess. Your answer should be in the form of a list of numbers, e.g., 5, 22, 3, ..., corresponding to the expression identifiers that fill the missing parts. For example, if your answer starts as 5, 22, 3, ..., then that means expression 5 fills <missing 1>, expression 22 fills <missing 2>, and expression 3 fills <missing 3>. Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nLet $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers, and let $N$ be a positive integer. Suppose that, for each $n > N$, $a_n$ is equal to the number of times $a_{n-1}$ appears in the list $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$.  Prove that at least one of the sequences $a_1, a_3, a_5, \\ldots$ and $a_2, a_4, a_6, \\ldots$ is eventually periodic.  (An infinite sequence $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots$ is eventually periodic if there exist positive integers $p$ and $M$ such that $b_{m+p} = b_m$ for all $m \\geq M$.)\n\nThe solution is:\nLet <missing 1> . We first prove that some integer appears infinitely many times. If not, then the sequence contains arbitrarily large integers. The first time each integer larger than $M$ appears, it is followed by a 1. So 1 appears infinitely many times, which is a contradiction.  Now we prove that every integer $x \\geq M$ appears at most <missing 2> times. If not, consider the first time that any $x \\geq M$ appears for the <missing 3> time. Up to this point, each appearance of $x$ is preceded by an integer which has appeared $x \\geq M$ times. So there must have been at least $M$ numbers that have already appeared at least $M$ times before $x$ does, which is a contradiction.  Thus there are only finitely many numbers that appear infinitely many times. Let the largest of these be $k$ . Since $k$ appears infinitely many times there must be infinitely many integers greater than $M$ which appear at least $k$ times in the sequence, so each integer <missing 4> also appears infinitely many times. Since <missing 5> doesn't appear infinitely often there must only be finitely many numbers which appear more than $k$ times. Let the largest such number be <missing 6> . From here on we call an integer $x$ big if <missing 7> , medium if <missing 8> and small if <missing 9> . To summarise, each small number appears infinitely many times in the sequence, while each big number appears at most $k$ times in the sequence.  Choose a large enough <missing 10> such that $a_{N'}$ is small, and in <missing 11> : every medium number has already made all of its appearances; every small number has made more than $\\max(k, N)$ appearances.  Since every small number has appeared more than $k$ times, past this point each small number must be followed by a big number. Also, by definition each big number appears at most $k$ times, so it must be followed by a small number. Hence the sequence alternates between big and small numbers after $a_{N'}$ .  \n Lemma 1. \n Let $g$ be a big number that appears after $a_{N'}$ . If $g$ is followed by the small number $h$ , then $h$ equals the amount of small numbers which have appeared at least $g$ times before that point.\n Proof. \n By the definition of <missing 12> , the small number immediately preceding $g$ has appeared more than $\\max(k, N)$ times, so <missing 13> . And since <missing 14> , the <missing 15> appearance of every small number must occur after $a_N$ and hence is followed by $g$ . Since there are $k$ small numbers and $g$ appears at most $k$ times, $g$ must appear exactly $k$ times, always following a small number after $a_N$ . Hence on the <missing 16> appearance of $g$ , exactly $h$ small numbers have appeared at least $g$ times before that point. $\\square$ Denote by <missing 17> the subsequence <missing 18> .  \n Lemma 2. \n Suppose that $i$ and $j$ satisfy the following conditions: (a) <missing 19> , (b) <missing 20> is small and <missing 21> , (c) no small value appears more than once in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ .  Then $a_{i-2}$ is equal to some small number in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . \n Proof. \n Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of small numbers that appear at least $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . By Lemma 1, <missing 22> . Similarly, let <missing 23> be the set of small numbers that appear at least $a_{j-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ . Then by Lemma 1, <missing 24> and hence by (b), $|\\mathcal{I}| = |\\mathcal{J}|$ . Also by definition, <missing 25> and <missing 26> .  Suppose the small number $a_{j-2}$ is not in $\\mathcal{I}$ . This means $a_{j-2}$ has appeared less than $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . By (c), $a_{j-2}$ has appeared at most $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ , hence <missing 27> . Combining with <missing 28> , this implies <missing 29> . But since <missing 30> , this contradicts $|\\mathcal{I}| = |\\mathcal{J}|$ . So <missing 31> , which means it has appeared at least $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ and one more time in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . Therefore <missing 32> .  By (c), any small number appearing at least $a_{j-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ has also appeared <missing 33> times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . So <missing 34> and hence <missing 35> . Therefore, <missing 36> , so it must appear at least <missing 37> more time in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . $\\square$ For each small number <missing 38> with <missing 39> , let $p_n$ be the smallest number such that $a_{n+p_n} = a_i$ is also small for some $i$ with <missing 40> . In other words, $a_{n+p_n} = a_i$ is the first small number to occur twice after <missing 41> . If <missing 42> , Lemma 2 (with <missing 43> ) implies that $a_{i-2}$ appears again before <missing 44> , contradicting the minimality of $p_n$ . So <missing 45> . Lemma 2 also implies that <missing 46> . So $p_n, p_{n+2}, p_{n+4}, \\ldots$ is a nondecreasing sequence bounded above by <missing 47> (as there are only $k$ small numbers). Therefore, $p_n, p_{n+2}, p_{n+4}, \\ldots$ is eventually constant and the subsequence of small numbers is eventually periodic with period at most $k$ .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 2> i > n \n<expression 3> a_{j-1} \\leq a_{i-1} \n<expression 4> g^{th} \n<expression 5> h^{th} \n<expression 6> a_{n+p_n} \n<expression 7> j = n + p_n \n<expression 8> a_{j-1}-1 \\geq a_{i-1} \n<expression 9> \\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 10> 1, 2, \\ldots, k - 1 \n<expression 11> g > \\max(k, N) \n<expression 12> l \\geq x > k \n<expression 13> p_n \\geq p_{n-2} \n<expression 14> a_i \n<expression 15> x \\leq k \n<expression 16> \\mathcal{J} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 17> a_i, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_j \n<expression 18> M^{th} \n<expression 19> a_{[i,j]} \n<expression 20> a_{[1,i-1]} \\subset a_{[1,j-1]} \n<expression 21> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 22> g > N \n<expression 23> x > l \n<expression 24> a_i = a_j \n<expression 25> N' \n<expression 26> j > i > N' + 2 \n<expression 27> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \\backslash \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 28> n \\leq i < n + p_n \n<expression 29> a_1, \\ldots, a_{N'} \n<expression 30> M > \\max(a_1, \\ldots, a_N) \n<expression 31> l \\geq k \n<expression 32> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 33> a_{j-1} - a_{i-1} = 1 \n<expression 34> a_j = |\\mathcal{J}| \n<expression 35> N' > N \n<expression 36> 2k \n<expression 37> a_{n-1} \n<expression 38> n > N' + 2 \n<expression 39> k + 1 \n<expression 40> \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 41> \\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 42> a_i = |\\mathcal{I}| \n<expression 43> i = n \n<expression 44> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 45> a_{j-1} > a_{i-1} \n<expression 46> M - 1 \n<expression 47> a_n \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "30,46,18,10,39,31,23,12,15,35,29,25,11,22,4,5,19,17,26,14,24,42,40,34,1,21,3,20,41,27,32,45,8,16,9,44,33,47,38,28,37,2,7,6,43,13,36", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 2> i > n \n<expression 3> a_{j-1} \\leq a_{i-1} \n<expression 4> g^{th} \n<expression 5> h^{th} \n<expression 6> a_{n+p_n} \n<expression 7> j = n + p_n \n<expression 8> a_{j-1}-1 \\geq a_{i-1} \n<expression 9> \\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 10> 1, 2, \\ldots, k - 1 \n<expression 11> g > \\max(k, N) \n<expression 12> l \\geq x > k \n<expression 13> p_n \\geq p_{n-2} \n<expression 14> a_i \n<expression 15> x \\leq k \n<expression 16> \\mathcal{J} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 17> a_i, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_j \n<expression 18> M^{th} \n<expression 19> a_{[i,j]} \n<expression 20> a_{[1,i-1]} \\subset a_{[1,j-1]} \n<expression 21> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 22> g > N \n<expression 23> x > l \n<expression 24> a_i = a_j \n<expression 25> N' \n<expression 26> j > i > N' + 2 \n<expression 27> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \\backslash \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 28> n \\leq i < n + p_n \n<expression 29> a_1, \\ldots, a_{N'} \n<expression 30> M > \\max(a_1, \\ldots, a_N) \n<expression 31> l \\geq k \n<expression 32> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 33> a_{j-1} - a_{i-1} = 1 \n<expression 34> a_j = |\\mathcal{J}| \n<expression 35> N' > N \n<expression 36> 2k \n<expression 37> a_{n-1} \n<expression 38> n > N' + 2 \n<expression 39> k + 1 \n<expression 40> \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 41> \\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 42> a_i = |\\mathcal{I}| \n<expression 43> i = n \n<expression 44> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 45> a_{j-1} > a_{i-1} \n<expression 46> M - 1 \n<expression 47> a_n \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

Initially, Turbo does not know where any of the monsters are, but he knows that there is exactly one monster in each row except the first row and the last row, and that each column contains at most one monster.  Turbo makes a series of attempts to go from the first row to the last row. On each attempt, he chooses to start on any cell in the first row, then repeatedly moves to an adjacent cell sharing a common side. (He is allowed to return to a previously visited cell.) If he reaches a cell with a monster, his attempt ends and he is transported back to the first row to start a new attempt. The monsters do not move, and Turbo remembers whether or not each cell he has visited contains a monster. If he reaches any cell in the last row, his attempt ends and the game is over.  Determine the minimum value of $n$ for which Turbo has a strategy that guarantees reaching the last row on the $n$-th attempt or earlier, regardless of the locations of the monsters\n\nThe solution is:\nFirst we demonstrate that there is no winning strategy if Turbo has 2 attempts.  Suppose that $(2,i)$ is the first cell in the second row that Turbo reaches on his first attempt. There can be a monster in this cell, in which case Turbo must return to the first row immediately, and he cannot have reached any other cells past the first row.  Next, suppose that $(3,j)$ is the first cell in the third row that Turbo reaches on his second attempt. Turbo must have moved to this cell from <missing 1> , so we know <missing 2> . So it is possible that there is a monster on $(3,j)$ , in which case Turbo also fails on his second attempt. Therefore Turbo cannot guarantee to reach the last row in 2 attempts.  Next, we exhibit a strategy for <missing 3> . On the first attempt, Turbo travels along the path <missing 4> This path meets every cell in the second row, so Turbo will find the monster in row 2 and his attempt will end.  If the monster in the second row is not on the edge of the board (that is, it is in cell $(2,i)$ with <missing 5> ), then Turbo takes the following two paths in his second and third attempts: <missing 6>  <missing 7> The only cells that may contain monsters in either of these paths are <missing 8> and <missing 9> . At most one of these can contain a monster, so at least one of the two paths will be successful.\nIf the monster in the second row is on the edge of the board, without loss of generality we may assume it is in $(2,1)$ . Then, on the second attempt, Turbo takes the following path: <missing 10> Here's the LaTeX conversion of the solution part, including all the text and using inline math delimiters as requested: If there are no monsters on this path, then Turbo wins. Otherwise, let $(i,j)$ be the first cell on which Turbo encounters a monster. We have that <missing 11> or <missing 12> . Then, on the third attempt, Turbo takes the following path: <missing 13>  <missing 14>  <missing 15> Now note that The cells from <missing 16> to <missing 17> do not contain monsters because they were reached earlier than $(i,j)$ on the previous attempt.  The cells <missing 18> for <missing 19> do not contain monsters because there is only one monster in row $i$ , and it lies in <missing 20> or <missing 21> .  The cells <missing 22> for <missing 23> do not contain monsters because there is at most one monster in column 1, and it lies in $(2,1)$ .

Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nLet $\\mathbb{Q}$ be the set of rational numbers. A function $f: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is called aquaesulian if the following property holds: for every $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, \n $f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y$ or $f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y).$\n Show that there exists an integer $c$ such that for any aquaesulian function $f$ there are at most $c$ different rational numbers of the form $f(r) + f(-r)$ for some rational number $r$, and find the smallest possible value of $c$.\n\nThe solution is:\nThe smallest value is <missing 1> .\n We begin by providing an example of a function $f$ for which there are two values of $g(x)$ . We take the function <missing 2> , where <missing 3> denotes the floor of $x$ (that is, the largest integer less than or equal to $x$ ) and <missing 4> denotes the fractional part of $x$ .  First, we show that $f$ satisfies <missing 5> . Given <missing 6> , we have <missing 7>  <missing 8> If <missing 9> , then we have that the fractional part of <missing 10> is <missing 11> and the floor is <missing 12> , so <missing 13> . Likewise, if <missing 14> , then <missing 15> . Finally, if <missing 16> , then <missing 17> is an integer. In all cases, the relation $P$ is satisfied.  Finally, we observe that if $x$ is an integer then <missing 18> , and if $x$ is not an integer then <missing 19> , so there are two values for $g(x)$ as required.  Now, we prove that there cannot be more than two values of $g(x)$ . <missing 20> tells us that <missing 21> , or in other words, for all $x$ , <missing 22> (1) \n Lemma 1. $f$ is a bijection, and satisfies <missing 23> (2) \n Proof. We first prove that $f$ is injective. Suppose that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ ; then <missing 24> tells us that <missing 25> . Without loss of generality, suppose that <missing 26> .  But $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ , so <missing 27> by (1). Therefore, <missing 28> , as required.  Now, (1) with <missing 29> tells us that <missing 30> and so by injectivity <missing 31> .  Applying <missing 32> tells us that <missing 33> , so either <missing 34> or <missing 35> which implies that <missing 36> by injectivity. Either way, we deduce that <missing 37> , or <missing 38> by replacing $x$ with $-x$ .  Finally, note that bijectivity follows immediately from (2). <missing 39> Since $f$ is bijective, it has an inverse, which we denote <missing 40> . Rearranging (2) (after replacing $x$ with $-x$ ) gives that <missing 41> . We have <missing 42> .  Suppose <missing 43> and <missing 44> , where $u \\neq v$ are both nonzero. Define <missing 45> and <missing 46> ; by definition, we have <missing 47>  <missing 48> Putting in <missing 49> gives <missing 50> , and putting in <missing 51> gives <missing 52> . These are not equal since $u \\neq v$ , and <missing 53> may have only one incoming and outgoing arrow because $f$ is a bijection, so we must have either <missing 54> or the same with the arrows reversed. Swapping <missing 55> and <missing 56> if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality that this is the correct direction for the arrows.  Also, we have <missing 57> by Lemma 1. Putting in <missing 58> gives <missing 59> , and so <missing 60> must be either <missing 61> or <missing 62> . This means $u$ must be either 0 or $v$ , and this contradicts our assumption about $u$ and $v$ .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> P(x,y) \n<expression 2> y' \\to y \\to y' + v. \n<expression 3> P(x,x) \n<expression 4> g(x) = 0 \n<expression 5> x + f(y) = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + {x} + \\lfloor y \\rfloor - {y} = (\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor) + ({x} - {y}). \n<expression 6> x' \\to x \\to x' + u \n<expression 7> f(x_1) + x_2 \\to f(x_2) + x_1 \n<expression 8> 0 = f(0) = x + f(-f(x)) \n<expression 9> y' + v \n<expression 10> x = 0 \n<expression 11> y \\sim y' + v - u \n<expression 12> x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q} \n<expression 13> f(x_2) + x_1 = f(x_2) + x_2 \n<expression 14> P(x, y') \n<expression 15> f(-f(-x)) = x. \n<expression 16> f(x) + y = \\lfloor x \\rfloor - {x} + \\lfloor y \\rfloor + {y} = (\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor) + ({y} - {x});

We can also see that <missing 3> does not work because the terms <missing 4> , and $24$ are consecutive factors of <missing 5> .

For each non-empty $T \\subseteq \\{S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_{100}\\}$, the size of the intersection of the sets in $T$ is a multiple of $|T|$. What is the smallest possible number of elements which are in at least 50 sets?\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is <missing 1> .  We encode with binary strings <missing 2> of length 100. Write <missing 3> if $w$ has 1's in every component $v$ does, and let $|v|$ denote the number of 1's in $v$ . Then for each $v$ , we let $f(v)$ denote the number of elements <missing 4> such that <missing 5> . So the problem condition means that $f(v)$ translates to the statement <missing 6> for any <missing 7> , plus one extra condition <missing 8> . And the objective function is to minimize the quantity <missing 9> . So the problem is transformed into a system of equations over <missing 10> . Note already that it suffices to assign $f(v)$ for $|v| \\geq 50$ , then we can always arbitrarily assign values of $f(v)$ for $|v| < 50$ by downwards induction on $|v|$ to satisfy the divisibility condition (without changing $M$ ). Thus for the rest of the solution, we altogether ignore $f(v)$ for $|v| < 50$ and only consider $P(u)$ for <missing 11> . Now consider the construction: <missing 12> This construction is valid since if <missing 13> for <missing 14> then <missing 15>  <missing 16> is indeed a multiple of <missing 17> , hence $P(u)$ is true. In that case, the objective function is <missing 18> as needed.\n\n\u00b6 Proof of bound. We are going to use a smoothing argument: if we have a general working assignment $f$ , we will mold it into <missing 19> . We define a push-down on $v$ as the following operation: Pick any $v$ such that $|v| \\geq 50$ and <missing 20> .  Decrease $f(v)$ by $|v|$ .  For every $w$ such that <missing 21> and <missing 22> , increase <missing 23> by 1.  Claim \u2014 Apply a push-down preserves the main divisibility condition. Moreover, it doesn't change $A$ unless $|v| = 50$ , where it decreases $A$ by 50 instead.  Proof. The statement $P(u)$ is only affected when <missing 24> : to be precise, one term on the right-hand side of $P(u)$ decreases by $|v|$ , while <missing 25> terms increase by 1, for a net change of <missing 26> . So $P(u)$ still holds.  To see $A$ doesn't change for <missing 27> , note $|v|$ terms increase by 1 while one term decreases by <missing 28> . When $|v| = 50$ , only $f(v)$ decreases by 50.\u25a1\nNow, given a valid assignment, we can modify it as follows: First apply pushdowns on <missing 29> until $f(1\\ldots1) = 100$ ; Then we may apply pushdowns on each $v$ with <missing 30> until <missing 31> ; Then we may apply pushdowns on each $v$ with <missing 32> until <missing 33> ; ...and so on, until we have <missing 34> for $|v| = 50$ .  Hence we get $f(1\\ldots1) = 100$ and <missing 35> for all <missing 36> . However, by downwards induction on <missing 37> , we also have <missing 38> since <missing 39> and $f(v)$ are both strictly less than $|v|$ . So in fact <missing 40> , and we're done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> 0 \\leq f(v) < |v| \n<expression 2> f_0(v) \n<expression 3> -|u| \n<expression 4> x\\in \\bigcup S_i \n<expression 5> u \\neq 0, \\dots 0 \n<expression 6> k \\leq 50 \n<expression 7> A := \\sum_{|v| \\geq 50} f(v) \n<expression 8> P(u): |u| \\texttt{ divides } \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f(v) \n<expression 9> 1\\ldots1 \n<expression 10> mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} \n<expression 11> |w| = |v| - 1 \n<expression 12> |u| \n<expression 13> f_0(v) = 2|v| - 100. \n<expression 14> |v| = 98 \n<expression 15> -|v| \n<expression 16> \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f_0(v) = \\binom{k}{0} \\cdot 100 + \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot 98 + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot 96 + \\cdots + \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot (100 - 2k) \n<expression 17> |v| > 50 \n<expression 18> A = \\sum_{i=50}^{100} \\binom{100}{i}(2i - 100) = 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 19> |v| = 99, 98, \\ldots, 50 \n<expression 20> f(v) \\equiv f_0(v) \\pmod{|v|} \\implies f(v) = f_0(v) \n<expression 21> x\\in S_i \\iff v_i = 1 \n<expression 22> 50 \\leq |v| \\leq 100 \n<expression 23> v \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{100} \n<expression 24> u \\subseteq v \n<expression 25> f(v) < 98 \n<expression 26> f_0 \n<expression 27> |v| = 99 \n<expression 28> f(v) \\geq |v| \n<expression 29> f(1\\dots 1) > 0 \n<expression 30> v \\subseteq w \n<expression 31> f = f_0 \n<expression 32> f(v) < 99 \n<expression 33> |v| - |u| \n<expression 34> w \\subseteq v \n<expression 35> |u| = 100 - k \n<expression 36> f(v) < 50 \n<expression 37> = (100 - k) \\cdot 2^k = |u| \\cdot 2^k \n<expression 38> f(w) \n<expression 39> 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 40> |u| \\geq 50 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "39,23,30,4,21,8,5,29,7,10,40,13,35,6,16,37,12,18,26,28,34,11,38,24,33,3,17,15,9,27,32,14,25,36,1,22,19,20,2,31", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> 0 \\leq f(v) < |v| \n<expression 2> f_0(v) \n<expression 3> -|u| \n<expression 4> x\\in \\bigcup S_i \n<expression 5> u \\neq 0, \\dots 0 \n<expression 6> k \\leq 50 \n<expression 7> A := \\sum_{|v| \\geq 50} f(v) \n<expression 8> P(u): |u| \\texttt{ divides } \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f(v) \n<expression 9> 1\\ldots1 \n<expression 10> mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} \n<expression 11> |w| = |v| - 1 \n<expression 12> |u| \n<expression 13> f_0(v) = 2|v| - 100. \n<expression 14> |v| = 98 \n<expression 15> -|v| \n<expression 16> \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f_0(v) = \\binom{k}{0} \\cdot 100 + \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot 98 + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot 96 + \\cdots + \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot (100 - 2k) \n<expression 17> |v| > 50 \n<expression 18> A = \\sum_{i=50}^{100} \\binom{100}{i}(2i - 100) = 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 19> |v| = 99, 98, \\ldots, 50 \n<expression 20> f(v) \\equiv f_0(v) \\pmod{|v|} \\implies f(v) = f_0(v) \n<expression 21> x\\in S_i \\iff v_i = 1 \n<expression 22> 50 \\leq |v| \\leq 100 \n<expression 23> v \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{100} \n<expression 24> u \\subseteq v \n<expression 25> f(v) < 98 \n<expression 26> f_0 \n<expression 27> |v| = 99 \n<expression 28> f(v) \\geq |v| \n<expression 29> f(1\\dots 1) > 0 \n<expression 30> v \\subseteq w \n<expression 31> f = f_0 \n<expression 32> f(v) < 99 \n<expression 33> |v| - |u| \n<expression 34> w \\subseteq v \n<expression 35> |u| = 100 - k \n<expression 36> f(v) < 50 \n<expression 37> = (100 - k) \\cdot 2^k = |u| \\cdot 2^k \n<expression 38> f(w) \n<expression 39> 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 40> |u| \\geq 50 \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

We wish to triangulate this $n$-gon into $n-2$ triangles each colored one of $m$ colors so that each color has an equal sum of areas. For which $(m,n)$ is such a triangulation and coloring possible?\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is if and only if $m$ is a proper divisor of $n$ .  Throughout this solution, we let <missing 1> and let the regular $n$ -gon have vertices <missing 2> . We cache the following frequent calculation: Lemma - The triangle with vertices <missing 3> has signed area <missing 4> .  Proof. Rotate by <missing 5> to assume WLOG that <missing 6> . Apply complex shoelace to the triangles with vertices <missing 7> to get <missing 8> which equals the above. \u25a1\n\nConstruction: It suffices to actually just take all the diagonals from the vertex 1, and then color the triangles with the $m$ colors in cyclic order. To see this works one can just do the shoelace calculation: for a given residue <missing 9> , we get an area <missing 10>  <missing 11>  <missing 12>  <missing 13> .  (We allow degenerate triangles where <missing 14> with area zero.) However, if $m$ is a proper divisor of $n$ , then <missing 15> . Similarly, <missing 16> . So the inner sum vanishes, and the total area of the $m$ -th color equals <missing 17> which does not depend on the residue $r$ , proving the coloring works. \u00b6 Proof of necessity. It's obvious that <missing 18> (in fact <missing 19> ). So we focus on just showing <missing 20> .  Repeating the same calculation as above, we find that if there was a valid triangulation and coloring, the total area of each color would equal <missing 21> .  However: Claim \u2014 The number <missing 22> is not an algebraic integer when <missing 23> .  Proof. This is easiest to see if one knows the advanced result that <missing 24> is a number field whose ring of integers is known to be <missing 25> . Hence if one takes <missing 26> as a <missing 27> -basis of $K$ , then <missing 28> is the subset where each coefficient is integer. \u25a1 However, each of the quantities <missing 29> is <missing 30> times an algebraic integer.

It turned out that no matter how the necklace was cut into $m$ blocks of $n$ consecutive beads, each block had a distinct number of red beads. Determine, with proof, all possible values of the ordered pair $(m, n)$\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is <missing 1> only.  Proof the task requires $m \\le n+1$ . Each of the $m$ blocks has a red bead count between $0$ and $n$ , each of which appears at most once, so $m \\le n+1$ is needed.  Construction when <missing 2> . For concreteness, here is the construction for <missing 3> , which obviously generalizes. The beads are listed in reading order as an array with <missing 4> rows and $n$ columns. Four of the blue beads have been labeled <missing 5> , \\dots, <missing 6> to make them easier to track as they move. <missing 7> To prove this construction works, it suffices to consider the $n$ cuts <missing 8> , <missing 9> , <missing 10> , \\dots, <missing 11> made where $T_i$ differs from <missing 12> by having the cuts one bead later also have the property each row has a distinct red count: <missing 13> We can construct a table showing for each <missing 14> the number of red beads which are in the <missing 15> st row of $T_i$ from the bottom: <missing 16> This suggests following explicit formula for the entry of the <missing 17> th cell which can then be checked straightforwardly: <missing 18> And one can see for each $i$ , the counts are all distinct (they are <missing 19> from bottom to top). This completes the construction.  Construction when <missing 20> . Fix $m$ .

Abbreviate <missing 2> , and WLOG assume <missing 3> . To prove the bound, we first rewrite the left-hand side using indicator functions and switch the order of summation as <missing 4>  <missing 5>  <missing 6> .  Hence, if we define the <missing 7> variables <missing 8> for each <missing 9> then the previous expression simplifies to just <missing 10> \u00b6 Proof of bound. We split the sum into $p = q$ versus $p \\neq q$ and bound by QM-AM separately in the obvious way. For the terms $p = q$ , <missing 11>  <missing 12> . When $p \\neq q$ we instead have <missing 13>  <missing 14> .  Combining the two bounds gives <missing 15> which matches the answer claimed above.  \u00b6 Construction. Equality occurs if <missing 16> is the same for all $p$ and <missing 17> is the same for all $p \\neq q$ , and <missing 18> for all $i$ .

Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nDetermine all real numbers $\\alpha$ such that, for every positive integer $n$, the integer \n $ |\\alpha| + |2\\alpha| + \\cdots + |n\\alpha| $ \n is a multiple of $n$. (Note that $[z]$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$. For example, $[-\\pi] = -4$ and $[2] = [2.9] = 2$.)\n\nThe solution is:\nAnswer: \n All even integers satisfy the condition of the problem and no other real number $\\alpha$ does so.  \n Solution 1. \n First we will show that even integers satisfy the condition. If <missing 1> where $m$ is an integer then <missing 2> which is a multiple of $n$ .  Now we will show that they are the only real numbers satisfying the conditions of the problem. Let <missing 3> where $k$ is an integer and $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Then the number <missing 4>  <missing 5> has to be a multiple of $n$ . We consider two cases based on the parity of $k$ .  \n Case 1: $k$ is even. \n Then <missing 6> is always a multiple of $n$ . Thus <missing 7> also has to be a multiple of $n$ .  We will prove that $[n\\epsilon] = 0$ for every positive integer $n$ by strong induction. The base case $n = 1$ follows from the fact that $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Let us suppose that <missing 8> for every $1 \\leq m < n$ . Then the number <missing 9> has to be a multiple of $n$ . As $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ then $0 \\leq n\\epsilon < n$ , which means that the number <missing 10> has to be equal to 0.  The equality $[n\\epsilon] = 0$ implies <missing 11> . Since this has to happen for all $n$ , we conclude that <missing 12> and then $\\alpha$ is an even integer. Case 2: $k$ is odd. \n We will prove that $[n\\epsilon] = n - 1$ for every natural number $n$ by strong induction. The base case $n = 1$ again follows from the fact that $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Let us suppose that <missing 13> for every $1 \\leq m < n$ . We need the number <missing 14>  <missing 15>  <missing 16> to be a multiple of $n$ . As $k$ is odd, we need <missing 17> to be a multiple of $n$ . Again, as $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ then $0 \\leq n\\epsilon < n$ , so $[n\\epsilon] = n - 1$ as we wanted.  This implies that <missing 18> for all $n$ which is absurd.

All powers of $a$ are then congruent modulo $g$ , so <missing 12> . Then <missing 13> and <missing 14> are both divisible by $g$ , so <missing 15> .

Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nLet $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers, and let $N$ be a positive integer. Suppose that, for each $n > N$, $a_n$ is equal to the number of times $a_{n-1}$ appears in the list $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$.  Prove that at least one of the sequences $a_1, a_3, a_5, \\ldots$ and $a_2, a_4, a_6, \\ldots$ is eventually periodic.  (An infinite sequence $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots$ is eventually periodic if there exist positive integers $p$ and $M$ such that $b_{m+p} = b_m$ for all $m \\geq M$.)\n\nThe solution is:\nLet <missing 1> . We first prove that some integer appears infinitely many times. If not, then the sequence contains arbitrarily large integers. The first time each integer larger than $M$ appears, it is followed by a 1. So 1 appears infinitely many times, which is a contradiction.  Now we prove that every integer $x \\geq M$ appears at most <missing 2> times. If not, consider the first time that any $x \\geq M$ appears for the <missing 3> time. Up to this point, each appearance of $x$ is preceded by an integer which has appeared $x \\geq M$ times. So there must have been at least $M$ numbers that have already appeared at least $M$ times before $x$ does, which is a contradiction.  Thus there are only finitely many numbers that appear infinitely many times. Let the largest of these be $k$ . Since $k$ appears infinitely many times there must be infinitely many integers greater than $M$ which appear at least $k$ times in the sequence, so each integer <missing 4> also appears infinitely many times. Since <missing 5> doesn't appear infinitely often there must only be finitely many numbers which appear more than $k$ times. Let the largest such number be <missing 6> . From here on we call an integer $x$ big if <missing 7> , medium if <missing 8> and small if <missing 9> . To summarise, each small number appears infinitely many times in the sequence, while each big number appears at most $k$ times in the sequence.  Choose a large enough <missing 10> such that $a_{N'}$ is small, and in <missing 11> : every medium number has already made all of its appearances; every small number has made more than $\\max(k, N)$ appearances.  Since every small number has appeared more than $k$ times, past this point each small number must be followed by a big number. Also, by definition each big number appears at most $k$ times, so it must be followed by a small number. Hence the sequence alternates between big and small numbers after $a_{N'}$ .  \n Lemma 1. \n Let $g$ be a big number that appears after $a_{N'}$ . If $g$ is followed by the small number $h$ , then $h$ equals the amount of small numbers which have appeared at least $g$ times before that point.\n Proof. \n By the definition of <missing 12> , the small number immediately preceding $g$ has appeared more than $\\max(k, N)$ times, so <missing 13> . And since <missing 14> , the <missing 15> appearance of every small number must occur after $a_N$ and hence is followed by $g$ . Since there are $k$ small numbers and $g$ appears at most $k$ times, $g$ must appear exactly $k$ times, always following a small number after $a_N$ . Hence on the <missing 16> appearance of $g$ , exactly $h$ small numbers have appeared at least $g$ times before that point. $\\square$ Denote by <missing 17> the subsequence <missing 18> .  \n Lemma 2. \n Suppose that $i$ and $j$ satisfy the following conditions: (a) <missing 19> , (b) <missing 20> is small and <missing 21> , (c) no small value appears more than once in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ .  Then $a_{i-2}$ is equal to some small number in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . \n Proof. \n Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of small numbers that appear at least $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . By Lemma 1, <missing 22> . Similarly, let <missing 23> be the set of small numbers that appear at least $a_{j-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ . Then by Lemma 1, <missing 24> and hence by (b), $|\\mathcal{I}| = |\\mathcal{J}|$ . Also by definition, <missing 25> and <missing 26> .  Suppose the small number $a_{j-2}$ is not in $\\mathcal{I}$ . This means $a_{j-2}$ has appeared less than $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . By (c), $a_{j-2}$ has appeared at most $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ , hence <missing 27> . Combining with <missing 28> , this implies <missing 29> . But since <missing 30> , this contradicts $|\\mathcal{I}| = |\\mathcal{J}|$ . So <missing 31> , which means it has appeared at least $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ and one more time in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . Therefore <missing 32> .  By (c), any small number appearing at least $a_{j-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ has also appeared <missing 33> times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . So <missing 34> and hence <missing 35> . Therefore, <missing 36> , so it must appear at least <missing 37> more time in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . $\\square$ For each small number <missing 38> with <missing 39> , let $p_n$ be the smallest number such that $a_{n+p_n} = a_i$ is also small for some $i$ with <missing 40> . In other words, $a_{n+p_n} = a_i$ is the first small number to occur twice after <missing 41> . If <missing 42> , Lemma 2 (with <missing 43> ) implies that $a_{i-2}$ appears again before <missing 44> , contradicting the minimality of $p_n$ . So <missing 45> . Lemma 2 also implies that <missing 46> . So $p_n, p_{n+2}, p_{n+4}, \\ldots$ is a nondecreasing sequence bounded above by <missing 47> (as there are only $k$ small numbers). Therefore, $p_n, p_{n+2}, p_{n+4}, \\ldots$ is eventually constant and the subsequence of small numbers is eventually periodic with period at most $k$ .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 2> N' \n<expression 3> a_i = a_j \n<expression 4> j > i > N' + 2 \n<expression 5> a_i = |\\mathcal{I}| \n<expression 6> n > N' + 2 \n<expression 7> \\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 8> g > N \n<expression 9> a_{j-1}-1 \\geq a_{i-1} \n<expression 10> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 11> M^{th} \n<expression 12> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \\backslash \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 13> a_n \n<expression 14> p_n \\geq p_{n-2} \n<expression 15> a_i, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_j \n<expression 16> g^{th} \n<expression 17> i > n \n<expression 18> a_{n-1} \n<expression 19> \\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 20> 1, 2, \\ldots, k - 1 \n<expression 21> x \\leq k \n<expression 22> \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 23> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 24> a_{j-1} \\leq a_{i-1} \n<expression 25> a_{[i,j]} \n<expression 26> 2k \n<expression 27> x > l \n<expression 28> a_{n+p_n} \n<expression 29> g > \\max(k, N) \n<expression 30> j = n + p_n \n<expression 31> l \\geq k \n<expression 32> k + 1 \n<expression 33> a_i \n<expression 34> M - 1 \n<expression 35> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 36> M > \\max(a_1, \\ldots, a_N) \n<expression 37> N' > N \n<expression 38> \\mathcal{J} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 39> a_{j-1} > a_{i-1} \n<expression 40> a_j = |\\mathcal{J}| \n<expression 41> a_1, \\ldots, a_{N'} \n<expression 42> i = n \n<expression 43> h^{th} \n<expression 44> n \\leq i < n + p_n \n<expression 45> a_{[1,i-1]} \\subset a_{[1,j-1]} \n<expression 46> l \\geq x > k \n<expression 47> a_{j-1} - a_{i-1} = 1 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "36,34,11,20,32,31,27,46,21,37,41,2,29,8,16,43,25,15,4,33,3,5,22,40,10,23,24,45,19,12,1,39,9,38,7,35,47,13,6,44,18,17,30,28,42,14,26", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 2> N' \n<expression 3> a_i = a_j \n<expression 4> j > i > N' + 2 \n<expression 5> a_i = |\\mathcal{I}| \n<expression 6> n > N' + 2 \n<expression 7> \\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 8> g > N \n<expression 9> a_{j-1}-1 \\geq a_{i-1} \n<expression 10> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 11> M^{th} \n<expression 12> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \\backslash \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 13> a_n \n<expression 14> p_n \\geq p_{n-2} \n<expression 15> a_i, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_j \n<expression 16> g^{th} \n<expression 17> i > n \n<expression 18> a_{n-1} \n<expression 19> \\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 20> 1, 2, \\ldots, k - 1 \n<expression 21> x \\leq k \n<expression 22> \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 23> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 24> a_{j-1} \\leq a_{i-1} \n<expression 25> a_{[i,j]} \n<expression 26> 2k \n<expression 27> x > l \n<expression 28> a_{n+p_n} \n<expression 29> g > \\max(k, N) \n<expression 30> j = n + p_n \n<expression 31> l \\geq k \n<expression 32> k + 1 \n<expression 33> a_i \n<expression 34> M - 1 \n<expression 35> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 36> M > \\max(a_1, \\ldots, a_N) \n<expression 37> N' > N \n<expression 38> \\mathcal{J} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 39> a_{j-1} > a_{i-1} \n<expression 40> a_j = |\\mathcal{J}| \n<expression 41> a_1, \\ldots, a_{N'} \n<expression 42> i = n \n<expression 43> h^{th} \n<expression 44> n \\leq i < n + p_n \n<expression 45> a_{[1,i-1]} \\subset a_{[1,j-1]} \n<expression 46> l \\geq x > k \n<expression 47> a_{j-1} - a_{i-1} = 1 \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

Let $X$ be the point on line $BC$ different from $C$ such that the line through $X$ parallel to $AC$ is tangent to $\\omega$.

Initially, Turbo does not know where any of the monsters are, but he knows that there is exactly one monster in each row except the first row and the last row, and that each column contains at most one monster.  Turbo makes a series of attempts to go from the first row to the last row. On each attempt, he chooses to start on any cell in the first row, then repeatedly moves to an adjacent cell sharing a common side. (He is allowed to return to a previously visited cell.) If he reaches a cell with a monster, his attempt ends and he is transported back to the first row to start a new attempt. The monsters do not move, and Turbo remembers whether or not each cell he has visited contains a monster. If he reaches any cell in the last row, his attempt ends and the game is over.  Determine the minimum value of $n$ for which Turbo has a strategy that guarantees reaching the last row on the $n$-th attempt or earlier, regardless of the locations of the monsters\n\nThe solution is:\nFirst we demonstrate that there is no winning strategy if Turbo has 2 attempts.  Suppose that $(2,i)$ is the first cell in the second row that Turbo reaches on his first attempt. There can be a monster in this cell, in which case Turbo must return to the first row immediately, and he cannot have reached any other cells past the first row.  Next, suppose that $(3,j)$ is the first cell in the third row that Turbo reaches on his second attempt. Turbo must have moved to this cell from <missing 1> , so we know <missing 2> . So it is possible that there is a monster on $(3,j)$ , in which case Turbo also fails on his second attempt. Therefore Turbo cannot guarantee to reach the last row in 2 attempts.  Next, we exhibit a strategy for <missing 3> . On the first attempt, Turbo travels along the path <missing 4> This path meets every cell in the second row, so Turbo will find the monster in row 2 and his attempt will end.  If the monster in the second row is not on the edge of the board (that is, it is in cell $(2,i)$ with <missing 5> ), then Turbo takes the following two paths in his second and third attempts: <missing 6>  <missing 7> The only cells that may contain monsters in either of these paths are <missing 8> and <missing 9> . At most one of these can contain a monster, so at least one of the two paths will be successful.\nIf the monster in the second row is on the edge of the board, without loss of generality we may assume it is in $(2,1)$ . Then, on the second attempt, Turbo takes the following path: <missing 10> Here's the LaTeX conversion of the solution part, including all the text and using inline math delimiters as requested: If there are no monsters on this path, then Turbo wins. Otherwise, let $(i,j)$ be the first cell on which Turbo encounters a monster. We have that <missing 11> or <missing 12> . Then, on the third attempt, Turbo takes the following path: <missing 13>  <missing 14>  <missing 15> Now note that The cells from <missing 16> to <missing 17> do not contain monsters because they were reached earlier than $(i,j)$ on the previous attempt.  The cells <missing 18> for <missing 19> do not contain monsters because there is only one monster in row $i$ , and it lies in <missing 20> or <missing 21> .  The cells <missing 22> for <missing 23> do not contain monsters because there is at most one monster in column 1, and it lies in $(2,1)$ .  Therefore Turbo will win on the third attempt.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> (1,2) \n<expression 2> \\to (i+1,1) \\to \\cdots \\to (2023,1) \\to (2024,1). \n<expression 3> (i,k) \n<expression 4> 2 \\leq i \\leq 2022 \n<expression 5> (i-1,i-1) \n<expression 6> (1,2) \\to (2,2) \\to (2,3) \\to (3,3) \\to \\cdots \\to (i-2,i-1) \\to (i-1,i-1) \n<expression 7> (2,j) \n<expression 8> (1,i-1) \\to (2,i-1) \\to (3,i-1) \\to (3,i) \\to (4,i) \\to \\cdots \\to (2024,i). \n<expression 9> j = i \n<expression 10> (3,i+1) \n<expression 11> 1 \\leq k \\leq i-1 \n<expression 12> j \\neq i \n<expression 13> (3,i-1) \n<expression 14> (1,1) \\to (2,1) \\to (2,2) \\to \\cdots \\to (2,2023). \n<expression 15> (i,i+1) \n<expression 16> i \\leq k \\leq 2024 \n<expression 17> \\to (i,i-1) \\to (i,i-2) \\to \\cdots \\to (i,2) \\to (i,1) \n<expression 18> (1,2) \\to (2,2) \\to (2,3) \\to (3,3) \\to \\cdots \\to (2022,2023) \\to (2023,2023) \\to (2024,2023). \n<expression 19> (1,i+1) \\to (2,i+1) \\to (3,i+1) \\to (3,i) \\to (4,i) \\to \\cdots \\to (2024,i). \n<expression 20> (i,i) \n<expression 21> j = i + 1 \n<expression 22> n = 3 \n<expression 23> (k,1) \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "7,12,22,14,4,8,19,13,10,18,9,21,6,17,2,1,5,3,11,20,15,23,16", "hardness": 1.0, "expressions": "<expression 1> (1,2) \n<expression 2> \\to (i+1,1) \\to \\cdots \\to (2023,1) \\to (2024,1). \n<expression 3> (i,k) \n<expression 4> 2 \\leq i \\leq 2022 \n<expression 5> (i-1,i-1) \n<expression 6> (1,2) \\to (2,2) \\to (2,3) \\to (3,3) \\to \\cdots \\to (i-2,i-1) \\to (i-1,i-1) \n<expression 7> (2,j) \n<expression 8> (1,i-1) \\to (2,i-1) \\to (3,i-1) \\to (3,i) \\to (4,i) \\to \\cdots \\to (2024,i). \n<expression 9> j = i \n<expression 10> (3,i+1) \n<expression 11> 1 \\leq k \\leq i-1 \n<expression 12> j \\neq i \n<expression 13> (3,i-1) \n<expression 14> (1,1) \\to (2,1) \\to (2,2) \\to \\cdots \\to (2,2023). \n<expression 15> (i,i+1) \n<expression 16> i \\leq k \\leq 2024 \n<expression 17> \\to (i,i-1) \\to (i,i-2) \\to \\cdots \\to (i,2) \\to (i,1) \n<expression 18> (1,2) \\to (2,2) \\to (2,3) \\to (3,3) \\to \\cdots \\to (2022,2023) \\to (2023,2023) \\to (2024,2023). \n<expression 19> (1,i+1) \\to (2,i+1) \\to (3,i+1) \\to (3,i) \\to (4,i) \\to \\cdots \\to (2024,i). \n<expression 20> (i,i) \n<expression 21> j = i + 1 \n<expression 22> n = 3 \n<expression 23> (k,1) \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-08-31", "livebench_removal_date": "", "release_date": null}

A function $f: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is called aquaesulian if the following property holds: for every $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, \n $f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y$ or $f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y).$\n Show that there exists an integer $c$ such that for any aquaesulian function $f$ there are at most $c$ different rational numbers of the form $f(r) + f(-r)$ for some rational number $r$, and find the smallest possible value of $c$.\n\nThe solution is:\nThe smallest value is <missing 1> .\n We begin by providing an example of a function $f$ for which there are two values of $g(x)$ . We take the function <missing 2> , where <missing 3> denotes the floor of $x$ (that is, the largest integer less than or equal to $x$ ) and <missing 4> denotes the fractional part of $x$ .  First, we show that $f$ satisfies <missing 5> . Given <missing 6> , we have <missing 7>  <missing 8> If <missing 9> , then we have that the fractional part of <missing 10> is <missing 11> and the floor is <missing 12> , so <missing 13> . Likewise, if <missing 14> , then <missing 15> . Finally, if <missing 16> , then <missing 17> is an integer. In all cases, the relation $P$ is satisfied.  Finally, we observe that if $x$ is an integer then <missing 18> , and if $x$ is not an integer then <missing 19> , so there are two values for $g(x)$ as required.  Now, we prove that there cannot be more than two values of $g(x)$ . <missing 20> tells us that <missing 21> , or in other words, for all $x$ , <missing 22> (1) \n Lemma 1. $f$ is a bijection, and satisfies <missing 23> (2) \n Proof. We first prove that $f$ is injective. Suppose that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ ; then <missing 24> tells us that <missing 25> . Without loss of generality, suppose that <missing 26> .  But $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ , so <missing 27> by (1). Therefore, <missing 28> , as required.  Now, (1) with <missing 29> tells us that <missing 30> and so by injectivity <missing 31> .  Applying <missing 32> tells us that <missing 33> , so either <missing 34> or <missing 35> which implies that <missing 36> by injectivity. Either way, we deduce that <missing 37> , or <missing 38> by replacing $x$ with $-x$ .  Finally, note that bijectivity follows immediately from (2). <missing 39> Since $f$ is bijective, it has an inverse, which we denote <missing 40> . Rearranging (2) (after replacing $x$ with $-x$ ) gives that <missing 41> . We have <missing 42> .  Suppose <missing 43> and <missing 44> , where $u \\neq v$ are both nonzero.

For example, if your answer starts as 5, 22, 3, ..., then that means expression 5 fills <missing 1>, expression 22 fills <missing 2>, and expression 3 fills <missing 3>.  \n\nThe question is:\nDetermine all composite integers $n>1$ that satisfy the following property: if $d_1,d_2,\\dots,d_k$ are all the positive divisors of $n$ with $1=d_1<d_2<\\dots<d_k=n$, then $d_i$ divides $d_{i+1}+d_{i+2}$ for every $1\\le i \\le k-2$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nIf $n$ has at least $2$ prime divisors, WLOG let $p<q$ be the smallest two of these primes. Then the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form <missing 1> for some integer $a\\geq 1$ .\n\nTo prove this claim, note that $p$ is the smallest prime that divides $n$ , so it is the smallest divisor not equal to $1$ , meaning the first $2$ divisors are $1$ and $p$ . Furthermore, the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$ (i.e. not equal to $(1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots)$ is equal to $q$ . This is because all other divisors either include a prime $z$ different from both $q$ and $p$ , which is larger than $q$ (since $q$ and $p$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$ ), or don\u2019t include a different prime $z$ . In the first case, since $z>q$ , the divisor is larger than $q$ . In the second case, all divisors divisible by $q^2$ are also larger than $q$ , and otherwise are of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ or $p^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$ . If the divisor is of the form $p^x$ , then it is a power of $p$ . If it is of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ , the smallest of these factors is $p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q$ . Therefore, (in the case where $2$ or more primes divide $n$ ) the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$ , since after each divisor <missing 2> , the next smallest divisor is either $p^{x+1}$ or simply $q$ .\n\nIf $a\\geq 2$ , the condition fails. This is because $p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q$ , since $p^a$ is divisible by $p^{a-1}$ , but $q$ is not since it is a prime different from $p$ . If $a=1$ , then $p^{a-1}=p^0=1$ , which does divide $q$ . Therefore $a$ must equal $1$ for the condition to be satisfied in this case. However, we know that the ordered list of divisors satisfies $d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n$ , meaning since the first $3$ divisors are $(1, p, q)$ , then the last $3$ divisors are $(\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n)$ , so $(\\frac{n}{q})$ must divide <missing 3> . But $\\frac{n}{q}$ is divisible by $p$ , so $\\frac{n}{p} + n$ must also be divisible by $p$ , but since $a=1$  $\\frac{n}{p}$ is and $n$ isn't.\n\nWhen $n=p^x$ , it is easy to verify this works for all primes $p$ and all $x\\geq 2$ , since $p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2}$ , and the divisors are ordered as ${1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x}$ .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> p^x \n<expression 2> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "2,1,3", "hardness": 0.1, "expressions": "<expression 1> p^x \n<expression 2> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

For example, if your answer starts as 5, 22, 3, ..., then that means expression 5 fills <missing 1>, expression 22 fills <missing 2>, and expression 3 fills <missing 3>.  \n\nThe question is:\nFor each integer $k \\geqslant 2$, determine all infinite sequences of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots$ for which there exists a polynomial $P$ of the form $P(x)=x^k+c_{k-1} x^{k-1}+\\cdots+c_1 x+c_0$, where $c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_{k-1}$ are non-negative integers, such that\\[P\\left(a_n\\right)=a_{n+1} a_{n+2} \\cdots a_{n+k}\\]for every integer $n \\geqslant 1$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nLet <missing 1> and <missing 2> be functions of positive integers $n$ and $j$ respectively.\n\nLet $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$ , then <missing 3> , and $a_{n+k}=a_{1}+f(n+k)$ Let $P=\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n+j} \\right ) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+g(j)) \\right )$ If we want the coefficients of $P(a_{n})$ to be positive, then $g(j)\\geq 0$ for all $j$ which will give the following value for $P$ : $P=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+\\prod_{j=1}^{k} g(j) = P(a_{n})$ Thus for every $j$ and $n$ we need the following: $a_{n}+g(j)=a_{n+j}=a_{1}+f(n+j)$ Solving for $g(j)$ we get: $g(j)=a_{1}+f(n+j)-a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n+j)-a_{1}-f(n)$  $g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)\\geq 0$ for all $n$ and $j$ because $g(j)$ needs to be greater than or equal to zero for all coefficients to be non-negative.\n\nThis means that $f(n)$ needs to be increasing with $n$ , or staying constant, and also with $f(1)=0$ because $a_{1}=a_{1}+f(1)$ .\n\nIn addition, since we need all coefficients to be integer, then all $f(n)$ and $g(j)$ must also be integers. We also need $g(j)$ to not be dependent of $n$ , so in the expression $f(n+j)-f(n)$ , the $n$ needs to cancel. This mean that the rate of change for $f(n)$ with respect to $n$ needs to be constant. This can only be achieved with $f(n)$ be the equation of a line with slope being either zero or positive integer.\n\nSo, we set $f(n)$ to be the equation of a line as $f(n)=mn+b$ with $m$ being the slope with a non-negative value and with $b$ the intercept at $n=0$ . We know that $f(1)=0$ so $f(1)=m+b=0$ which means that $b=-m$ and our function becomes $f(n)=mn-m=(n-1)m$ . Since $f(n)$ needs to be non-negative integer then $m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ then $f(n)$ is increasing or constant, with $f(1)=0$ Then, $g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)=(n+j-1)m-(n-1)m=jm$ This gives: $\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+jm \\right )=P(a_{n})=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+k!m^{k}$ with $C_{0}=k!m^{k}$ and coefficients of polynomial <missing 4> Then, $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$ Which provides the solution of all infinite sequences of positive integers as: $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)m$ , $\\forall m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_{1} \\geq 1 \\mid a_{1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ \n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> f(n) \n<expression 2> \\geq 0 \n<expression 3> g(j) \n<expression 4> a_{n+1}=a_{1}+f(n+1) \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "1,3,4,2", "hardness": 0.1, "expressions": "<expression 1> f(n) \n<expression 2> \\geq 0 \n<expression 3> g(j) \n<expression 4> a_{n+1}=a_{1}+f(n+1) \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

For example, if your answer starts as 5, 22, 3, ..., then that means expression 5 fills <missing 1>, expression 22 fills <missing 2>, and expression 3 fills <missing 3>.  \n\nThe question is:\nDetermine all composite integers $n>1$ that satisfy the following property: if $d_1,d_2,\\dots,d_k$ are all the positive divisors of $n$ with $1=d_1<d_2<\\dots<d_k=n$, then $d_i$ divides $d_{i+1}+d_{i+2}$ for every $1\\le i \\le k-2$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nIf $n$ has at least $2$ prime divisors, WLOG let <missing 1> be the smallest two of these primes. Then the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form <missing 2> for some integer $a\\geq 1$ .\n\nTo prove this claim, note that $p$ is the smallest prime that divides $n$ , so it is the smallest divisor not equal to $1$ , meaning the first $2$ divisors are $1$ and $p$ . Furthermore, the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$ (i.e. not equal to $(1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots)$ is equal to $q$ . This is because all other divisors either include a prime $z$ different from both $q$ and $p$ , which is larger than $q$ (since $q$ and $p$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$ ), or don\u2019t include a different prime $z$ . In the first case, since <missing 3> , the divisor is larger than $q$ . In the second case, all divisors divisible by <missing 4> are also larger than $q$ , and otherwise are of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ or $p^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$ . If the divisor is of the form <missing 5> , then it is a power of $p$ . If it is of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ , the smallest of these factors is <missing 6> . Therefore, (in the case where $2$ or more primes divide $n$ ) the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$ , since after each divisor <missing 7> , the next smallest divisor is either <missing 8> or simply $q$ .\n\nIf $a\\geq 2$ , the condition fails. This is because $p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q$ , since <missing 9> is divisible by $p^{a-1}$ , but $q$ is not since it is a prime different from $p$ . If $a=1$ , then $p^{a-1}=p^0=1$ , which does divide $q$ . Therefore $a$ must equal $1$ for the condition to be satisfied in this case. However, we know that the ordered list of divisors satisfies <missing 10> , meaning since the first $3$ divisors are <missing 11> , then the last $3$ divisors are <missing 12> , so <missing 13> must divide <missing 14> . But $\\frac{n}{q}$ is divisible by $p$ , so <missing 15> must also be divisible by $p$ , but since $a=1$  $\\frac{n}{p}$ is and $n$ isn't.\n\nWhen $n=p^x$ , it is easy to verify this works for all primes $p$ and all <missing 16> , since <missing 17> , and the divisors are ordered as ${1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x}$ .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> p^x \n<expression 2> q^2 \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n}{q}) \n<expression 4> p<q \n<expression 5> p^x \n<expression 6> x\\geq 2 \n<expression 7> p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q \n<expression 8> p^a \n<expression 9> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n<expression 10> (1, p, q) \n<expression 11> p^{x+1} \n<expression 12> \\frac{n}{p} + n \n<expression 13> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 14> p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2} \n<expression 15> d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n \n<expression 16> (\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n) \n<expression 17> z>q \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "4,13,17,2,1,7,5,11,8,15,10,16,3,9,12,6,14", "hardness": 0.5, "expressions": "<expression 1> p^x \n<expression 2> q^2 \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n}{q}) \n<expression 4> p<q \n<expression 5> p^x \n<expression 6> x\\geq 2 \n<expression 7> p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q \n<expression 8> p^a \n<expression 9> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n<expression 10> (1, p, q) \n<expression 11> p^{x+1} \n<expression 12> \\frac{n}{p} + n \n<expression 13> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 14> p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2} \n<expression 15> d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n \n<expression 16> (\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n) \n<expression 17> z>q \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

For example, if your answer starts as 5, 22, 3, ..., then that means expression 5 fills <missing 1>, expression 22 fills <missing 2>, and expression 3 fills <missing 3>.  \n\nThe question is:\nFor each integer $k \\geqslant 2$, determine all infinite sequences of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots$ for which there exists a polynomial $P$ of the form $P(x)=x^k+c_{k-1} x^{k-1}+\\cdots+c_1 x+c_0$, where $c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_{k-1}$ are non-negative integers, such that\\[P\\left(a_n\\right)=a_{n+1} a_{n+2} \\cdots a_{n+k}\\]for every integer $n \\geqslant 1$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nLet <missing 1> and $g(j)$ be functions of positive integers $n$ and $j$ respectively.\n\nLet <missing 2> , then <missing 3> , and <missing 4> Let <missing 5> If we want the coefficients of <missing 6> to be positive, then <missing 7> for all $j$ which will give the following value for $P$ : <missing 8> Thus for every $j$ and $n$ we need the following: $a_{n}+g(j)=a_{n+j}=a_{1}+f(n+j)$ Solving for <missing 9> we get: $g(j)=a_{1}+f(n+j)-a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n+j)-a_{1}-f(n)$  $g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)\\geq 0$ for all $n$ and $j$ because $g(j)$ needs to be greater than or equal to zero for all coefficients to be non-negative.\n\nThis means that <missing 10> needs to be increasing with $n$ , or staying constant, and also with <missing 11> because $a_{1}=a_{1}+f(1)$ .\n\nIn addition, since we need all coefficients to be integer, then all $f(n)$ and $g(j)$ must also be integers. We also need <missing 12> to not be dependent of $n$ , so in the expression $f(n+j)-f(n)$ , the $n$ needs to cancel. This mean that the rate of change for $f(n)$ with respect to $n$ needs to be constant. This can only be achieved with $f(n)$ be the equation of a line with slope being either zero or positive integer.\n\nSo, we set <missing 13> to be the equation of a line as $f(n)=mn+b$ with $m$ being the slope with a non-negative value and with $b$ the intercept at <missing 14> . We know that $f(1)=0$ so <missing 15> which means that $b=-m$ and our function becomes <missing 16> . Since <missing 17> needs to be non-negative integer then <missing 18> then $f(n)$ is increasing or constant, with <missing 19> Then, $g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)=(n+j-1)m-(n-1)m=jm$ This gives: <missing 20> with $C_{0}=k!m^{k}$ and coefficients of polynomial $\\geq 0$ Then, $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$ Which provides the solution of all infinite sequences of positive integers as: <missing 21> , $\\forall m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_{1} \\geq 1 \\mid a_{1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ \n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> a_{n+1}=a_{1}+f(n+1) \n<expression 2> f(n) \n<expression 3> a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)m \n<expression 4> \\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+jm \\right )=P(a_{n})=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+k!m^{k} \n<expression 5> n=0 \n<expression 6> P=\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n+j} \\right ) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+g(j)) \\right ) \n<expression 7> f(1)=0 \n<expression 8> a_{n+k}=a_{1}+f(n+k) \n<expression 9> m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \n<expression 10> f(n) \n<expression 11> P(a_{n}) \n<expression 12> g(j) \n<expression 13> f(1)=0 \n<expression 14> P=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+\\prod_{j=1}^{k} g(j) = P(a_{n}) \n<expression 15> g(j) \n<expression 16> f(n)=mn-m=(n-1)m \n<expression 17> a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n) \n<expression 18> f(1)=m+b=0 \n<expression 19> g(j)\\geq 0 \n<expression 20> f(n) \n<expression 21> f(n) \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "20,17,1,8,6,11,19,14,12,2,13,15,10,5,18,16,21,9,7,4,3", "hardness": 0.5, "expressions": "<expression 1> a_{n+1}=a_{1}+f(n+1) \n<expression 2> f(n) \n<expression 3> a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)m \n<expression 4> \\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+jm \\right )=P(a_{n})=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+k!m^{k} \n<expression 5> n=0 \n<expression 6> P=\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n+j} \\right ) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+g(j)) \\right ) \n<expression 7> f(1)=0 \n<expression 8> a_{n+k}=a_{1}+f(n+k) \n<expression 9> m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \n<expression 10> f(n) \n<expression 11> P(a_{n}) \n<expression 12> g(j) \n<expression 13> f(1)=0 \n<expression 14> P=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+\\prod_{j=1}^{k} g(j) = P(a_{n}) \n<expression 15> g(j) \n<expression 16> f(n)=mn-m=(n-1)m \n<expression 17> a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n) \n<expression 18> f(1)=m+b=0 \n<expression 19> g(j)\\geq 0 \n<expression 20> f(n) \n<expression 21> f(n) \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

Then the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form <missing 2> for some integer $a\\geq 1$ .\n\nTo prove this claim, note that $p$ is the smallest prime that divides $n$ , so it is the smallest divisor not equal to $1$ , meaning the first $2$ divisors are $1$ and $p$ . Furthermore, the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$ (i.e. not equal to <missing 3> is equal to $q$ . This is because all other divisors either include a prime $z$ different from both $q$ and $p$ , which is larger than $q$ (since $q$ and $p$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$ ), or don\u2019t include a different prime $z$ . In the first case, since <missing 4> , the divisor is larger than $q$ . In the second case, all divisors divisible by <missing 5> are also larger than $q$ , and otherwise are of the form <missing 6> or $p^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$ . If the divisor is of the form <missing 7> , then it is a power of $p$ . If it is of the form <missing 8> , the smallest of these factors is <missing 9> . Therefore, (in the case where $2$ or more primes divide $n$ ) the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form <missing 10> for some integer <missing 11> , since after each divisor <missing 12> , the next smallest divisor is either $p^{x+1}$ or simply $q$ .\n\nIf <missing 13> , the condition fails. This is because $p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q$ , since <missing 14> is divisible by <missing 15> , but $q$ is not since it is a prime different from $p$ . If <missing 16> , then $p^{a-1}=p^0=1$ , which does divide $q$ . Therefore $a$ must equal $1$ for the condition to be satisfied in this case. However, we know that the ordered list of divisors satisfies $d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n$ , meaning since the first $3$ divisors are $(1, p, q)$ , then the last $3$ divisors are <missing 17> , so <missing 18> must divide <missing 19> . But <missing 20> is divisible by $p$ , so <missing 21> must also be divisible by $p$ , but since <missing 22>  <missing 23> is and $n$ isn't.\n\nWhen <missing 24> , it is easy to verify this works for all primes $p$ and all <missing 25> , since <missing 26> , and the divisors are ordered as <missing 27> .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> p^x \n<expression 2> (\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n) \n<expression 3> p<q \n<expression 4> z>q \n<expression 5> n=p^x \n<expression 6> \\frac{n}{p} \n<expression 7> a\\geq 2 \n<expression 8> p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2} \n<expression 9> p^a \n<expression 10> p^x \n<expression 11> a=1 \n<expression 12> a\\geq 1 \n<expression 13> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n<expression 14> (\\frac{n}{q}) \n<expression 15> p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q \n<expression 16> q^2 \n<expression 17> x\\geq 2 \n<expression 18> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 19> \\frac{n}{p} + n \n<expression 20> (1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots) \n<expression 21> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 22> {1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x} \n<expression 23> a=1 \n<expression 24> p^x \\cdot q^1 \n<expression 25> p^x \\cdot q^1 \n<expression 26> p^{a-1} \n<expression 27> \\frac{n}{q} \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "3,21,20,4,16,25,1,24,15,18,12,10,7,9,26,11,2,14,13,27,19,23,6,5,17,8,22", "hardness": 0.8, "expressions": "<expression 1> p^x \n<expression 2> (\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n) \n<expression 3> p<q \n<expression 4> z>q \n<expression 5> n=p^x \n<expression 6> \\frac{n}{p} \n<expression 7> a\\geq 2 \n<expression 8> p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2} \n<expression 9> p^a \n<expression 10> p^x \n<expression 11> a=1 \n<expression 12> a\\geq 1 \n<expression 13> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n<expression 14> (\\frac{n}{q}) \n<expression 15> p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q \n<expression 16> q^2 \n<expression 17> x\\geq 2 \n<expression 18> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 19> \\frac{n}{p} + n \n<expression 20> (1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots) \n<expression 21> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 22> {1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x} \n<expression 23> a=1 \n<expression 24> p^x \\cdot q^1 \n<expression 25> p^x \\cdot q^1 \n<expression 26> p^{a-1} \n<expression 27> \\frac{n}{q} \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

We say that a collection $C$ of identical dominoes is a maximal grid-aligned configuration on the board if $C$ consists of $(n^2-1)/2$ dominoes where each domino covers exactly two neighboring squares and the dominoes don't overlap: $C$ then covers all but one square on the board. We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n-Consider an $n$-by-$n$ board of unit squares for some odd positive integer $n$.

We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nWe claim the answer is $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ .\n-We claim the answer is $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ .\n\nFirst, consider a checkerboard tiling of the board with 4 colors: R, G, B, Y. Number each column from $1$ to $n$ from left to right and each row from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom. We color a tile R if its row and column are odd, a tile G is its row is even but its column is odd, a tile B if its row and column is even, and a tile Y if its row is odd but its column is even.\n\nLemma 1: Throughout our moves, the color of the uncolored tile stays an invariant.\n\nConsider that a domino can either only change rows or can only change columns. Therefore, sliding a domino into the hole and creating a new one has two possible colors. Of these, note that the new hole will always trivially be two tiles away from the old hole, meaning that the parity of both the row and column number stays the same. Thus, the lemma holds.\n\nLemma 2: There are more red tiles than any other color. Because each color is uniquely defined by the parity of a pair of column and row number, it satisfies to show that given an odd integer $n$ , there are more odd positive integers less than or equal to $n$ than even ones. Obviously, this is true, and so red will have more tiles than any other color.\n\nLemma 3: For any starting configuration $C$ and any blank tile $B$ such that the blank tile's color matches the blank tile's color of $C$ , there is no more than one unique configuration $C'$ that can be produced from $C$ using valid moves.\n\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists two different $C'$ . We can get from one of these $C'$ to another using moves. However, we have to finish off with the same hole as before. Before the last move, the hole must be two tiles away from the starting hole. However, because the domino we used to move into the blank tile's spot is in the way, that hole must be congruent to the hole produced after the first move. We can induct this logic, and because there is a limited amount of tiles with the same color, eventually we will run out of tiles to apply this to. Therefore, having two distinct $C'$ with the same starting hole $B$ is impossible with some $C$ .\n\nWe will now prove that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the answer. There are <missing 1> rows and $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ columns that are odd, and thus there are $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ red tiles. Given lemma 3, this is our upper bound for a maximum. To establish that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is indeed possible, we construct such a $C$ :\n\nIn the first column, leave the first tile up blank. Then, continuously fill in vertically oriented dominos in that column until it reaches the bottom. In the next $n-1$ columns, place $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top. At the bottom row, starting with the first unfilled tile on the left, place horizontally aligned dominos in a row until you reach the right.\n\nObviously, the top left tile is red. It suffices to show that any red tile may be uncovered. For the first column, one may slide some dominos on the first column until the desired tile is uncovered. For the bottom row, all the first dominos may be slid up, and then the bottom dominos may be slid to the left until the desired red tile is uncovered. Finally, for the rest of the red tiles, the bottom red tile in the same color may be revealed, and then vertically aligned dominos in the same column may be slid down until the desired tile is revealed. Therefore, this configuration may produce $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ different configurations with moves.\n\nHence, we have proved that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the maximum, and we are done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> \\frac{n+1}{2} \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "1", "hardness": 0.1, "expressions": "<expression 1> \\frac{n+1}{2} \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

Alice and Bob play the following game. On Alice's turn, she must replace some integer $n$ on the board with $n+a$, and on Bob's turn he must replace some even integer $n$ on the board with $n/2$. Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n-A positive integer $a$ is selected, and some positive integers are written on a board. Alice and Bob play the following game. On Alice's turn, she must replace some integer $n$ on the board with $n+a$, and on Bob's turn he must replace some even integer $n$ on the board with $n/2$. Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n\nAfter analyzing the integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nThe contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever). So we want to prove that, if the game can potentially last indefinitely, then Alice can force it to last indefinitely. Clearly, if there is $1$ number on the board initially, all moves are forced. This means the claim is true in this specific case, because if the game \"potentially\" can last forever, this means it must last forever, since the game can only be played in one way. Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n-The contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever).

Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n\n\nCase 1: $v_2 (a)=0$ The game lasts forever here no matter what. This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$ , Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$ , Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number n on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$ , meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when $v_2 (a)=0$ , so we're done.\n\n\nCase 2: $v_2 (a)=1$ If there is at least one number n on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=1$ . This way, the new number $n'= n+a$ satisfies $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . If Bob does divides $n'$ until $v_2 (n)=1$ , Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\nIf there is no even number on the board, then the game can clearly not last forever. No matter what Alice does, Bob will have no even number to divide after her move.\n\n\nGeneral Case: $v_2 (a)=x$ In general, it seems to be the case that the game can last indefinitely for some given $a$ if and only if there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , so we should aim to prove this.\n\n1. \"If\"\n\nAlice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ . If she does this addition, then $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ , keeping an even number on the board. Even if Bob divides $n'$ until $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ , Alice will apply the same strategy and keep <missing 1> . Alice's use of this strategy ensures that there always exists some number n on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , ensuring there always exists an even number n on the board.\n\n2.\"Only If\"\n\nIf $v_2 (n) < v_2 (a)$ for all n on the board, this means that Alice can never change the value of <missing 2> for any $n$ on the board. Only Bob can do this, and Bob will subtract $1$ from each $v_2 (n)$ until they are all equal to $0$ (all odd), ending the game.\n\nWe've shown that the game can last indefinitely iff there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , and have shown that Alice can ensure the game lasts forever in these scenarios using the above strategy. This proves the contrapositive, proving the claim.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> v_2 (n) \n<expression 2> v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "2,1", "hardness": 0.1, "expressions": "<expression 1> v_2 (n) \n<expression 2> v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1 \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

Look at the term $a^2b+ab$ ; we claim it cannot be part of a column that has cells forming an arithmetic sequence after any appropriate rearranging. After such a rearrangement, if the column it is in has common difference $d<ab=n$ , then <missing 1> must also be in its column, which is impossible. If the column has difference $d > ab = n$ , then no element in the next row can be in its column. If the common difference is $d = ab = n$ , then $a^2b + ab - 2d = a^2b - ab$ and $a^2b + ab - d = a^2b$ , which are both in the row above it, must both be in the same column, which is impossible.

We say that a collection $C$ of identical dominoes is a maximal grid-aligned configuration on the board if $C$ consists of $(n^2-1)/2$ dominoes where each domino covers exactly two neighboring squares and the dominoes don't overlap: $C$ then covers all but one square on the board. We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n-Consider an $n$-by-$n$ board of unit squares for some odd positive integer $n$.

We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nWe claim the answer is <missing 1> .\n-We claim the answer is <missing 2> .\n\nFirst, consider a checkerboard tiling of the board with 4 colors: R, G, B, Y. Number each column from $1$ to $n$ from left to right and each row from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom. We color a tile R if its row and column are odd, a tile G is its row is even but its column is odd, a tile B if its row and column is even, and a tile Y if its row is odd but its column is even.\n\nLemma 1: Throughout our moves, the color of the uncolored tile stays an invariant.\n\nConsider that a domino can either only change rows or can only change columns. Therefore, sliding a domino into the hole and creating a new one has two possible colors. Of these, note that the new hole will always trivially be two tiles away from the old hole, meaning that the parity of both the row and column number stays the same. Thus, the lemma holds.\n\nLemma 2: There are more red tiles than any other color. Because each color is uniquely defined by the parity of a pair of column and row number, it satisfies to show that given an odd integer $n$ , there are more odd positive integers less than or equal to $n$ than even ones. Obviously, this is true, and so red will have more tiles than any other color.\n\nLemma 3: For any starting configuration $C$ and any blank tile $B$ such that the blank tile's color matches the blank tile's color of $C$ , there is no more than one unique configuration $C'$ that can be produced from $C$ using valid moves.\n\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists two different $C'$ . We can get from one of these $C'$ to another using moves. However, we have to finish off with the same hole as before. Before the last move, the hole must be two tiles away from the starting hole. However, because the domino we used to move into the blank tile's spot is in the way, that hole must be congruent to the hole produced after the first move. We can induct this logic, and because there is a limited amount of tiles with the same color, eventually we will run out of tiles to apply this to. Therefore, having two distinct <missing 3> with the same starting hole $B$ is impossible with some $C$ .\n\nWe will now prove that <missing 4> is the answer. There are $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ rows and $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ columns that are odd, and thus there are <missing 5> red tiles. Given lemma 3, this is our upper bound for a maximum. To establish that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is indeed possible, we construct such a $C$ :\n\nIn the first column, leave the first tile up blank. Then, continuously fill in vertically oriented dominos in that column until it reaches the bottom. In the next <missing 6> columns, place $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top. At the bottom row, starting with the first unfilled tile on the left, place horizontally aligned dominos in a row until you reach the right.\n\nObviously, the top left tile is red. It suffices to show that any red tile may be uncovered. For the first column, one may slide some dominos on the first column until the desired tile is uncovered. For the bottom row, all the first dominos may be slid up, and then the bottom dominos may be slid to the left until the desired red tile is uncovered. Finally, for the rest of the red tiles, the bottom red tile in the same color may be revealed, and then vertically aligned dominos in the same column may be slid down until the desired tile is revealed. Therefore, this configuration may produce $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ different configurations with moves.\n\nHence, we have proved that <missing 7> is the maximum, and we are done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> C' \n<expression 2> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 4> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 5> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 6> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 7> n-1 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "3,5,1,2,4,7,6", "hardness": 0.5, "expressions": "<expression 1> C' \n<expression 2> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 4> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 5> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 6> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 7> n-1 \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n\nAfter analyzing the integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nThe contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever). So we want to prove that, if the game can potentially last indefinitely, then Alice can force it to last indefinitely. Clearly, if there is $1$ number on the board initially, all moves are forced. This means the claim is true in this specific case, because if the game \"potentially\" can last forever, this means it must last forever, since the game can only be played in one way. Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n-The contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever).

Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n\n\nCase 1: $v_2 (a)=0$ The game lasts forever here no matter what. This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$ , Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$ , Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number n on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$ , meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when <missing 1> , so we're done.\n\n\nCase 2: $v_2 (a)=1$ If there is at least one number n on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if <missing 2> . This way, the new number <missing 3> satisfies $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . If Bob does divides <missing 4> until $v_2 (n)=1$ , Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in <missing 5> . This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\nIf there is no even number on the board, then the game can clearly not last forever. No matter what Alice does, Bob will have no even number to divide after her move.\n\n\nGeneral Case: $v_2 (a)=x$ In general, it seems to be the case that the game can last indefinitely for some given $a$ if and only if there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , so we should aim to prove this.\n\n1. \"If\"\n\nAlice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ . If she does this addition, then $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ , keeping an even number on the board. Even if Bob divides <missing 6> until <missing 7> , Alice will apply the same strategy and keep $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ . Alice's use of this strategy ensures that there always exists some number n on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , ensuring there always exists an even number n on the board.\n\n2.\"Only If\"\n\nIf $v_2 (n) < v_2 (a)$ for all n on the board, this means that Alice can never change the value of <missing 8> for any $n$ on the board. Only Bob can do this, and Bob will subtract $1$ from each <missing 9> until they are all equal to $0$ (all odd), ending the game.\n\nWe've shown that the game can last indefinitely iff there exists some number $n$ on the board such that <missing 10> , and have shown that Alice can ensure the game lasts forever in these scenarios using the above strategy.

We say that a collection $C$ of identical dominoes is a maximal grid-aligned configuration on the board if $C$ consists of $(n^2-1)/2$ dominoes where each domino covers exactly two neighboring squares and the dominoes don't overlap: $C$ then covers all but one square on the board. We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n-Consider an $n$-by-$n$ board of unit squares for some odd positive integer $n$.

We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nWe claim the answer is <missing 1> .\n-We claim the answer is <missing 2> .\n\nFirst, consider a checkerboard tiling of the board with 4 colors: R, G, B, Y. Number each column from $1$ to $n$ from left to right and each row from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom. We color a tile R if its row and column are odd, a tile G is its row is even but its column is odd, a tile B if its row and column is even, and a tile Y if its row is odd but its column is even.\n\nLemma 1: Throughout our moves, the color of the uncolored tile stays an invariant.\n\nConsider that a domino can either only change rows or can only change columns. Therefore, sliding a domino into the hole and creating a new one has two possible colors. Of these, note that the new hole will always trivially be two tiles away from the old hole, meaning that the parity of both the row and column number stays the same. Thus, the lemma holds.\n\nLemma 2: There are more red tiles than any other color. Because each color is uniquely defined by the parity of a pair of column and row number, it satisfies to show that given an odd integer $n$ , there are more odd positive integers less than or equal to $n$ than even ones. Obviously, this is true, and so red will have more tiles than any other color.\n\nLemma 3: For any starting configuration $C$ and any blank tile $B$ such that the blank tile's color matches the blank tile's color of $C$ , there is no more than one unique configuration $C'$ that can be produced from $C$ using valid moves.\n\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists two different <missing 3> . We can get from one of these $C'$ to another using moves. However, we have to finish off with the same hole as before. Before the last move, the hole must be two tiles away from the starting hole. However, because the domino we used to move into the blank tile's spot is in the way, that hole must be congruent to the hole produced after the first move. We can induct this logic, and because there is a limited amount of tiles with the same color, eventually we will run out of tiles to apply this to. Therefore, having two distinct $C'$ with the same starting hole $B$ is impossible with some $C$ .\n\nWe will now prove that <missing 4> is the answer. There are <missing 5> rows and <missing 6> columns that are odd, and thus there are <missing 7> red tiles. Given lemma 3, this is our upper bound for a maximum. To establish that <missing 8> is indeed possible, we construct such a $C$ :\n\nIn the first column, leave the first tile up blank. Then, continuously fill in vertically oriented dominos in that column until it reaches the bottom. In the next <missing 9> columns, place <missing 10> vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top. At the bottom row, starting with the first unfilled tile on the left, place horizontally aligned dominos in a row until you reach the right.\n\nObviously, the top left tile is red. It suffices to show that any red tile may be uncovered. For the first column, one may slide some dominos on the first column until the desired tile is uncovered. For the bottom row, all the first dominos may be slid up, and then the bottom dominos may be slid to the left until the desired red tile is uncovered. Finally, for the rest of the red tiles, the bottom red tile in the same color may be revealed, and then vertically aligned dominos in the same column may be slid down until the desired tile is revealed. Therefore, this configuration may produce <missing 11> different configurations with moves.\n\nHence, we have proved that <missing 12> is the maximum, and we are done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> \\frac{n+1}{2} \n<expression 2> \\frac{n-1}{2} \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 4> \\frac{n+1}{2} \n<expression 5> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 6> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 7> n-1 \n<expression 8> C' \n<expression 9> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 10> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 11> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 12> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "10,6,8,5,4,1,9,12,7,2,3,11", "hardness": 0.8, "expressions": "<expression 1> \\frac{n+1}{2} \n<expression 2> \\frac{n-1}{2} \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 4> \\frac{n+1}{2} \n<expression 5> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 6> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 7> n-1 \n<expression 8> C' \n<expression 9> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 10> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 11> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 12> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2023}

Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n\nAfter analyzing the integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nThe contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever). So we want to prove that, if the game can potentially last indefinitely, then Alice can force it to last indefinitely. Clearly, if there is $1$ number on the board initially, all moves are forced. This means the claim is true in this specific case, because if the game \"potentially\" can last forever, this means it must last forever, since the game can only be played in one way. Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n-The contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever).

Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n\n\nCase 1: <missing 1> The game lasts forever here no matter what. This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$ , Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$ , Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number n on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$ , meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when <missing 2> , so we're done.\n\n\nCase 2: <missing 3> If there is at least one number n on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=1$ . This way, the new number $n'= n+a$ satisfies <missing 4> . If Bob does divides $n'$ until <missing 5> , Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in <missing 6> . This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\nIf there is no even number on the board, then the game can clearly not last forever. No matter what Alice does, Bob will have no even number to divide after her move.\n\n\nGeneral Case: <missing 7> In general, it seems to be the case that the game can last indefinitely for some given $a$ if and only if there exists some number $n$ on the board such that <missing 8> , so we should aim to prove this.\n\n1. \"If\"\n\nAlice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2.

Look at the term <missing 11> ; we claim it cannot be part of a column that has cells forming an arithmetic sequence after any appropriate rearranging. After such a rearrangement, if the column it is in has common difference <missing 12> , then $a^2b+ab-d$ must also be in its column, which is impossible. If the column has difference $d > ab = n$ , then no element in the next row can be in its column. If the common difference is <missing 13> , then <missing 14> and $a^2b + ab - d = a^2b$ , which are both in the row above it, must both be in the same column, which is impossible.

For example, if your answer starts as 5, 22, 3, ..., then that means expression 5 fills <missing 1>, expression 22 fills <missing 2>, and expression 3 fills <missing 3>.  \n\nThe question is:\nFind all integers $n \\geq 3$ such that the following property holds: if we list the divisors of $n !$ in increasing order as $1=d_1<d_2<\\cdots<d_k=n!$, then we have \\[ d_2-d_1 \\leq d_3-d_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq d_k-d_{k-1} .\\]\n-Find all integers $n \\geq 3$ such that the following property holds: if we list the divisors of $n !$ in increasing order as $1=d_1<d_2<\\cdots<d_k=n!$, then we have \\[ d_2-d_1 \\leq d_3-d_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq d_k-d_{k-1} .\\]\n\n\nThe solution is:\nWe can start by verifying that $n=3$ and $n=4$ work by listing out the factors of $3!$ and $4!$ . We can also see that <missing 1> does not work because the terms $15, 20$ , and $24$ are consecutive factors of <missing 2> . Also, <missing 3> does not work because the terms $6, 8$ , and $9$ appear consecutively in the factors of $6!$ .\n-We can start by verifying that $n=3$ and <missing 4> work by listing out the factors of $3!$ and $4!$ . We can also see that $n=5$ does not work because the terms <missing 5> , and $24$ are consecutive factors of $5!$ . Also, <missing 6> does not work because the terms <missing 7> , and $9$ appear consecutively in the factors of <missing 8> .\n\nNote that if we have a prime number <missing 9> and an integer <missing 10> such that both $k$ and <missing 11> are factors of $n!$ , then the condition cannot be satisfied.\n\nIf <missing 12> is odd, then $(2)(\\frac{n-1}{2})(n-1)=n^2-2n+1$ is a factor of $n!$ . Also, <missing 13> is a factor of <missing 14> . Since <missing 15> for all $n\\geq7$ , we can use Bertrand's Postulate to show that there is at least one prime number $p$ such that <missing 16> . Since we have two consecutive factors of $n!$ and a prime number between the smaller of these factors and $n$ , the condition will not be satisfied for all odd <missing 17> .\n\nIf <missing 18> is even, then <missing 19> is a factor of $n!$ . Also, $(n-3)(n-1)=n^2-4n+3$ is a factor of $n!$ . Since $2n<n^2-4n+3$ for all $n\\geq8$ , we can use Bertrand's Postulate again to show that there is at least one prime number $p$ such that $n<p<n^2-4n+3$ . Since we have two consecutive factors of <missing 20> and a prime number between the smaller of these factors and $n$ , the condition will not be satisfied for all even <missing 21> .\n\nTherefore, the only numbers that work are <missing 22> and <missing 23> .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> n=5 \n<expression 2> 15, 20 \n<expression 3> n\\geq7 \n<expression 4> n=6 \n<expression 5> n=4 \n<expression 6> n! \n<expression 7> 6, 8 \n<expression 8> n<p<n^2-2n \n<expression 9> p>n \n<expression 10> k>p \n<expression 11> n=3 \n<expression 12> (n-2)(n)=n^2-2n \n<expression 13> n! \n<expression 14> 5! \n<expression 15> k+1 \n<expression 16> (2)(\\frac{n-2}{2})(n-2)=n^2-4n+4 \n<expression 17> n=6 \n<expression 18> n\\geq8 \n<expression 19> n=4 \n<expression 20> 6! \n<expression 21> n\\geq8 \n<expression 22> 2n<n^2-2n \n<expression 23> n\\geq7 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"], "ground_truth": "1,14,17,19,2,4,7,20,9,10,15,23,12,6,22,8,3,18,16,13,21,11,5", "hardness": 0.5, "expressions": "<expression 1> n=5 \n<expression 2> 15, 20 \n<expression 3> n\\geq7 \n<expression 4> n=6 \n<expression 5> n=4 \n<expression 6> n! \n<expression 7> 6, 8 \n<expression 8> n<p<n^2-2n \n<expression 9> p>n \n<expression 10> k>p \n<expression 11> n=3 \n<expression 12> (n-2)(n)=n^2-2n \n<expression 13> n! \n<expression 14> 5! \n<expression 15> k+1 \n<expression 16> (2)(\\frac{n-2}{2})(n-2)=n^2-4n+4 \n<expression 17> n=6 \n<expression 18> n\\geq8 \n<expression 19> n=4 \n<expression 20> 6! \n<expression 21> n\\geq8 \n<expression 22> 2n<n^2-2n \n<expression 23> n\\geq7 \n", "livebench_release_date": "2024-06-24", "livebench_removal_date": "2024-08-31", "release_date": 2024}
