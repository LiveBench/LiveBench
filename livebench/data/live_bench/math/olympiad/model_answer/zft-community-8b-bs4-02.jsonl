This is likely referring to the function \\( f \\) defined in the problem. The function \\( f \\) is defined as \\( f(x) = \\lfloor x \\rfloor - \\{x\\} \\).

This is directly given by <expression 14> (which states \\( \\{x\\} = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\)).\n\n5. **<missing 5>**: <missing 5> tells us that <missing 21> . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\) or \\( f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y) \\). Therefore, <missing 5> should be matched with <expression 20> (which states \\( x = f(-f(-x)) \\)).\n\n6. **<missing 6>**: Given <missing 6> , we have <missing 7> . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 6> should be matched with <expression 21> (which states \\( f(x_1) + x_2 \\sim f(x_2) + x_1 \\)).\n\n7. **<missing 7>**: <missing 7>  <missing 8> .

Therefore, <missing 8> should be matched with <expression 23> (which states \\( f(-f(-x)) = x \\)).\n\n9. **<missing 9>**: If <missing 9> , then we have that the fractional part of <missing 10> is <missing 11> and the floor is <missing 12> , so <missing 13> . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\).

This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 11> should be matched with <expression 26> (which states \\( (y, v) \\)).\n\n12. **<missing 12>**: <missing 12> . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\).

This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 13> should be matched with <expression 28> (which states \\( x' \\to x \\to x' + u \\)).\n\n14. **<missing 14>**: If <missing 14> , then <missing 15> . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 14> should be matched with <expression 29> (which states \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor \\)).\n\n15. **<missing 15>**: <missing 15> . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 15> should be matched with <expression 30> (which states \\( y' + v \\)).\n\n16. **<missing 16>**: Finally, if <missing 16> , then <missing 17> is an integer.

Therefore, <missing 16> should be matched with <expression 31> (which states \\( f(x_1) + x_2 \\to f(x_2) + x_1 \\)).\n\n17. **<missing 17>**: <missing 17> . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 17> should be matched with <expression 32> (which states \\( f(0) = 0 \\)).\n\n18. **<missing 18>**: In all cases, the relation \\( P \\) is satisfied. This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 18> should be matched with <expression 33> (which states \\( {y} - {x} \\)).\n\n19. **<missing 19>**: Finally, we observe that if \\( x \\) is an integer then <missing 18> , and if \\( x \\) is not an integer then <missing 19> , so there are two values for \\( g(x) \\) as required. This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 19> should be matched with <expression 34> (which states \\( -x' - u \\to -x \\to -x' \\)).\n\n20. **<missing 20>**: <missing 20> tells us that <missing 21> , or in other words, for all \\( x \\) , <missing 22> (1) . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 20> should be matched with <expression 35> (which states \\( f(x) + y \\)).\n\n21. **<missing 21>**: <missing 21> . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 21> should be matched with <expression 36> (which states \\( P(x, -f(x)) \\)).\n\n22. **<missing 22>**: (1) . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 22> should be matched with <expression 37> (which states \\( f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x) \\)).\n\n23. **<missing 23>**: Lemma 1. \\( f \\) is a bijection, and satisfies <missing 23> (2) . This is likely referring to the property \\( f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y \\). Therefore, <missing 23> should be matched with <expression 38> (which states \\( 0 \\sim x + f(-f(x)) \\)).\n\n24. **<missing 24>**: We first prove that \\( f \\) is injective. Suppose that \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\) ; then <missing 24> tells us that <missing 25> .

This suggests that the cuts are made at positions \\(i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\). Therefore, <missing 8> should be \\(i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\).\n\n9. **<missing 9>**: The \\(n\\) cuts <missing 8> are made where \\(T_i\\) differs from <missing 12> by having the cuts one bead later also have the property each row has a distinct red count.

This suggests that the cuts are made at positions \\(i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\). Therefore, <missing 10> should be \\(i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\).\n\n11. **<missing 11>**: The \\(n\\) cuts <missing 8> are made where \\(T_i\\) differs from <missing 12> by having the cuts one bead later also have the property each row has a distinct red count.

This suggests that the cuts are made at positions \\(i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\). Therefore, <missing 12> should be \\(T_0\\).\n\n13. **<missing 13>**: We can construct a table showing for each <missing 14> the number of red beads which are in the <missing 15> st row of \\(T_i\\) from the bottom. This suggests that the table is constructed for each \\(i\\) and \\(k\\). Therefore, <missing 13> should be \\(i\\) and \\(k\\).\n\n14. **<missing 14>**: We can construct a table showing for each <missing 14> the number of red beads which are in the <missing 15> st row of \\(T_i\\) from the bottom.

Therefore, <missing 18> should be the formula.\n\n19. **<missing 19>**: And one can see for each \\(i\\), the counts are all distinct (they are <missing 19> from bottom to top). This suggests that the counts are distinct and range from 0 to \\(n\\). Therefore, <missing 19> should be \\(k\\).\n\n20. **<missing 20>**: Construction when <missing 20> is needed. This suggests that the construction works when \\(m = n+1\\). Therefore, <missing 20> should be \\(m = n+1\\).\n\n21. **<missing 21>**: Fix \\(m\\). Take the construction for <missing 21> and add \\(n+1-m\\) cyan beads to the start of each row. This suggests that the construction is taken for \\(m = n+1\\). Therefore, <missing 21> should be \\(m = n+1\\).\n\n22. **<missing 22>**: Fix \\(m\\). Take the construction for <missing 21> and add \\(n+1-m\\) cyan beads to the start of each row.

Take the construction for <missing 21> and add \\(n+1-m\\) cyan beads to the start of each row. This suggests that the construction is taken for \\(m = n+1\\). Therefore, <missing 23> should be \\(m = n+1\\).\n\n24. **<missing 24>**: This construction still works for the same reason (the cyan beads do nothing for the first \\(n+1-m\\) shifts, then one reduces to the previous case). If we treat cyan as a shade of blue, this finishes the problem. This suggests that the construction is taken for \\(m = n+1\\). Therefore, <missing 24> should be \\(T_{n-1}\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 22, 3, 7, 5, 6, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 2"]}], "tstamp": 1755247793.0535073, "total_output_tokens": 2048, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

Let's go through the solution step by step and identify the appropriate formulae for each missing tag.\n\n1. **<missing 1>**: The answer is <missing 1>. This is the final answer we are looking for, which is the smallest possible number of elements in at least 50 sets. The formula that directly gives this answer is <expression 18>, which states that \\( A = \\sum_{i=50}^{100} \\binom{100}{i}(2i - 100) = 50\\binom{100}{50} \\). Therefore, <missing 1> = 18.\n\n2. **<missing 2>**: We encode with binary strings <missing 2> of length 100. This is a general statement about encoding, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. However, it sets the context for the rest of the solution. We can leave this as <missing 2> for now.\n\n3. **<missing 3>**: Write <missing 3> if \\( w \\) has 1's in every component \\( v \\) does. This is a condition on the binary strings, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 3> for now.\n\n4. **<missing 4>**: Then for each \\( v \\), we let \\( f(v) \\) denote the number of elements <missing 4> such that <missing 5>. This is a definition of \\( f(v) \\), and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 4> for now.\n\n5. **<missing 5>**: So the problem condition means that \\( f(v) \\) translates to the statement <missing 6> for any <missing 7>, plus one extra condition <missing 8>. This is a statement about the problem condition, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 5> for now.\n\n6. **<missing 6>**: And the objective function is to minimize the quantity <missing 9>. This is a statement about the objective function, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 6> for now.\n\n7. **<missing 7>**: Note already that it suffices to assign \\( f(v) \\) for \\( |v| \\geq 50 \\), then we can always arbitrarily assign values of \\( f(v) \\) for \\( |v| < 50 \\) by downwards induction on \\( |v| \\) to satisfy the divisibility condition (without changing \\( M \\)). Thus for the rest of the solution, we altogether ignore \\( f(v) \\) for \\( |v| < 50 \\) and only consider \\( P(u) \\) for <missing 11>. This is a statement about the assignment of \\( f(v) \\), and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 7> for now.\n\n8. **<missing 8>**: Now consider the construction: <missing 12>. This is a statement about the construction, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 8> for now.\n\n9. **<missing 9>**: This construction is valid since if <missing 13> for <missing 14> then <missing 15> <missing 16> is indeed a multiple of <missing 17>, hence \\( P(u) \\) is true. In that case, the objective function is <missing 18> as needed. This is a statement about the validity of the construction, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 9> for now.\n\n10. **<missing 10>**: Proof of bound. We are going to use a smoothing argument: if we have a general working assignment \\( f \\), we will mold it into <missing 19>. We define a push-down on \\( v \\) as the following operation: Pick any \\( v \\) such that \\( |v| \\geq 50 \\) and <missing 20>. Decrease \\( f(v) \\) by \\( |v| \\). For every \\( w \\) such that <missing 21> and <missing 22>, increase <missing 23> by 1. This is a statement about the proof of bound, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 10> for now.\n\n11. **<missing 11>**: Claim \u2014 Apply a push-down preserves the main divisibility condition. Moreover, it doesn't change \\( A \\) unless \\( |v| = 50 \\), where it decreases \\( A \\) by 50 instead. Proof. The statement \\( P(u) \\) is only affected when <missing 24>: to be precise, one term on the right-hand side of \\( P(u) \\) decreases by \\( |v| \\), while <missing 25> terms increase by 1, for a net change of <missing 26>. So \\( P(u) \\) still holds. To see \\( A \\) doesn't change for <missing 27>, note \\( |v| \\) terms increase by 1 while one term decreases by <missing 28>. When \\( |v| = 50 \\), only \\( f(v) \\) decreases by 50.\u25a1 This is a statement about the claim, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 11> for now.\n\n12. **<missing 12>**: Now, given a valid assignment, we can modify it as follows: First apply pushdowns on <missing 29> until \\( f(1\\ldots1) = 100 \\); Then we may apply pushdowns on each \\( v \\) with <missing 30> until <missing 31>; Then we may apply pushdowns on each \\( v \\) with <missing 32> until <missing 33>; ...and so on, until we have <missing 34> for \\( |v| = 50 \\). Hence we get \\( f(1\\ldots1) = 100 \\) and <missing 35> for all <missing 36>. However, by downwards induction on <missing 37>, we also have <missing 38> since <missing 39> and \\( f(v) \\) are both strictly less than \\( |v| \\). So in fact <missing 40>, and we're done. This is a statement about the modification of the assignment, and it doesn't directly correspond to any specific formula. We can leave this as <missing 12> for now.\n\nAfter going through the solution, we can see that the only formula that directly corresponds to the final answer is <expression 18>.

The goal is to find the smallest number of elements that are in at least 50 sets, given certain conditions on the sizes of intersections.\n\n2. **Encoding with Binary Strings**: The solution suggests encoding the sets with binary strings of length 100.
