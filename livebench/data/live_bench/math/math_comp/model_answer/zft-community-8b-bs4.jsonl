The inradius can be calculated using the formula $r = \\frac{A}{s}$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle and $s$ is the semiperimeter. The semiperimeter is half the perimeter of the triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of the three sides. The area of a triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula, which states that $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the three sides. In this problem, we are given that the inradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. We are also given that eight circles of radius $34$ can be placed tangent to $\\overline{BC}$ of $\\triangle ABC$ so that the circles are sequentially tangent to each other, with the first circle being tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ and the last circle being tangent to $\\overline{AC}$. Similarly, $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be placed tangent to $\\overline{BC}$ in the same manner. This means that the length of $\\overline{BC}$ is $8 \\times 34 + 2024 \\times 1 = 2680$. Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the lengths of the sides of $\\triangle ABC$. Then, the semiperimeter is $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2} = \\frac{a+b+2680}{2}$. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a+b+2680}{2} \\cdot \\frac{b+2680-a}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a+2680-b}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2680}{2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{(a+b+2680)(b+2680-a)(a+2680-b)(2680)}$. The inradius is $r = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{(a+b+2680)(b+2680-a)(a+2680-b)(2680)}}{\\frac{a+b+2680}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{(b+2680-a)(a+2680-b)}{a+b+2680}}$. Since $r = \\frac{m}{n}$, we have $\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{(b+2680-a)(a+2680-b)}{a+b+2680}}$. Squaring both sides, we get $\\frac{m^2}{n^2} = \\frac{(b+2680-a)(a+2680-b)}{4(a+b+2680)}$. Multiplying both sides by $4(a+b+2680)$, we get $4m^2(a+b+2680) = n^2(b+2680-a)(a+2680-b)$. Expanding both sides, we get $4m^2a + 4m^2b + 4m^2 \\cdot 2680 = n^2b^2 + n^2 \\cdot 2680^2 - n^2ab - n^2 \\cdot 2680a - n^2 \\cdot 2680b + n^2a^2$. Rearranging terms, we get $n^2a^2 - 4m^2a + n^2b^2 - 4m^2b + n^2 \\cdot 2680^2 - n^2 \\cdot 2680a - n^2 \\cdot 2680b + 4m^2 \\cdot 2680 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the discriminant of this equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant is $D = (4m^2)^2 - 4(n^2)(n^2 \\cdot 2680^2 - n^2 \\cdot 2680a - n^2 \\cdot 2680b + 4m^2 \\cdot 2680) = 16m^4 - 4n^4 \\cdot 2680^2 + 4n^4 \\cdot 2680a + 4n^4 \\cdot 2680b - 16m^2 \\cdot 2680$. Since $D$ is a perfect square, we have $16m^4 - 4n^4 \\cdot 2680^2 + 4n^4 \\cdot 2680a + 4n^4 \\cdot 2680b - 16m^2 \\cdot 2680 = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging terms, we get $16m^4 - 16m^2 \\cdot 2680 = k^2 + 4n^4 \\cdot 2680^2 - 4n^4 \\cdot 2680a - 4n^4 \\cdot 2680b$. Factoring out $16m^2$, we get $16m^2(m^2 - 2680) = k^2 + 4n^4 \\cdot 2680^2 - 4n^4 \\cdot 2680a - 4n^4 \\cdot 2680b$. Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, $m^2 - 2680$ must be a perfect square. Let $m^2 - 2680 = p^2$ for some integer $p$. Then, $m^2 = p^2 + 2680$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $p$ must be a nonnegative integer. We can try different values of $p$ to find a solution. If $p = 0$, then $m^2 = 2680$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 1$, then $m^2 = 2681$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 2$, then $m^2 = 2684$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 3$, then $m^2 = 2689$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 4$, then $m^2 = 2696$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 5$, then $m^2 = 2705$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 6$, then $m^2 = 2716$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 7$, then $m^2 = 2729$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 8$, then $m^2 = 2744$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 9$, then $m^2 = 2761$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 10$, then $m^2 = 2780$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 11$, then $m^2 = 2801$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 12$, then $m^2 = 2824$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 13$, then $m^2 = 2849$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 14$, then $m^2 = 2876$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 15$, then $m^2 = 2905$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 16$, then $m^2 = 2936$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 17$, then $m^2 = 2969$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 18$, then $m^2 = 3004$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 19$, then $m^2 = 3041$, which is not a perfect square. If $p = 20$, then $m^2 = 3080$, which is not a perfect square.
