This skepticism arises from two observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We demonstrate that the models with the same pre-training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream tasks. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks -- irrespective of the continuity of metrics -- when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models with lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be predicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher pre-training losses."]}], "tstamp": 1754990606.6548846, "total_output_tokens": 205, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}

In practical contexts, the grating geometry is mono-periodic but it is enlightened by a 3D plane wave with a wavevector outside of the plane of invariance. Consequently, this study deals with the resolution of a direct and inverse problem using the Finite Element Method in this intermediate state between 2D and 3D: the so-called conical incidence.

A key challenge of 6G-oriented ISAC lies in how to perform ubiquitous sensing based on the communication signals and devices. Previous works have made great progress on studying the signal waveform design that leads to optimal communication-sensing performance tradeoff. In this article, we aim to focus on issues arising from the exploitation of the communication devices for sensing in 6G network. Particularly, we will discuss how to leverage various nodes available in the cellular network as anchors to perform ubiquitous sensing. On one hand, the base stations (BSs) will be the most important anchors in the future 6G ISAC network, since they can generate/process radio signals with high range/angle resolutions, and their positions are precisely known. Correspondingly, we will first study the BS-based sensing technique. On the other hand, the BSs alone may not enable ubiquitous sensing, since they cannot cover all the places with strong line-of-sight (LOS) links. This motivates us to investigate the possibility of using other nodes that are with higher density in the network to act as the anchors. Along this line, we are interested in two types of new anchors - user equipments (UEs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This paper will shed light on the opportunities and challenges brought by UE-assisted sensing and RIS-assisted sensing.

This results in a multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction problem. A desired model for this problem should satisfy the following requirements: 1) Accuracy: the model should achieve fine-grained accuracy with respect to any conversion type in any display scenario. 2) Scalability: the model parameter size should be affordable. 3) Convenience: the model should not require a large amount of effort in data partitioning, subset processing and separate storage. Existing approaches cannot simultaneously satisfy these requirements. For example, building a separate model for each (conversion type, display scenario) pair is neither scalable nor convenient. Building a unified model trained on all the data with conversion type and display scenario included as two features is not accurate enough. In this paper, we propose the Masked Multi-domain Network (MMN) to solve this problem. To achieve the accuracy requirement, we model domain-specific parameters and propose a dynamically weighted loss to account for the loss scale imbalance issue within each mini-batch. To achieve the scalability requirement, we propose a parameter sharing and composition strategy to reduce model parameters from a product space to a sum space. To achieve the convenience requirement, we propose an auto-masking strategy which can take mixed data from all the domains as input. It avoids the overhead caused by data partitioning, individual processing and separate storage.

Molecular simulation in the presence of electric fields would give important atomistic insight into these processes but applications of the most accurate methods such as ab-initio molecular dynamics are limited in scope by the computational expense. Here we introduce Perturbed Neural Network Potential Molecular Dynamics (PNNP MD) to push back accessible time and length scales of such simulations at virtually no loss in accuracy. The total forces on each atom are expressed in terms of the unperturbed potential energy surface represented by a standard neural network potential and a field-induced perturbation obtained from a series expansion of the field interaction truncated at first order. The latter is represented in terms of an equivariant graph neural network, trained on the atomic polar tensor. PNNP MD is shown to give excellent results for the dielectric relaxation dynamics, the dielectric constant and the field-dependent IR spectrum of liquid water when compared to ab-initio molecular dynamics or experiment, up to surprisingly high field strengths of about 0.2 V/A. This is remarkable because, in contrast to most previous approaches, the two neural networks on which PNNP MD is based are exclusively trained on zero-field molecular configurations demonstrating that the networks not only interpolate but also reliably extrapolate the field response. PNNP MD is based on rigorous theory yet it is simple, general, modular, and systematically improvable allowing us to obtain atomistic insight into the interaction of a wide range of condensed phase systems with external electric fields."]}], "tstamp": 1754990580.8638191, "total_output_tokens": 340, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}
