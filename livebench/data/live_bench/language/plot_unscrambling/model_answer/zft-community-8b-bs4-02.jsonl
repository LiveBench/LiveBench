Bea rushes upstairs to Cal, who comforts her. Playing one of her grandmother's records inspires Margaret to dance and she remembers Blossom, instilling Bea with hope. Following a tip, Bea, Cal, and Blue find Blue's original kid, Jeremy, now a grown man trying to launch a business. By eating a fresh croissant in front of Jeremy, Bea reminds him of his childhood home above his parents' bakery; Jeremy remembers Blue enough for Blue to give Jeremy the confidence he needs for a business presentation. Talking with her grandmother, she sees a picture of her as a young dancer and recognizes Blossom in the background of the picture. That evening, Bea arrives at Margaret's to find her hastily preparing for a return to the hospital because there's been a complication with her father's treatment. Bea rushes back to see Cal, now able to see him again, and wishes him a farewell. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father. She awakens in Cal's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends, nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. When Bea says she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, Cal advises her to tell him a story instead. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. He wakes up and they reassure each other. She chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents and a clown named Calvin. She, Cal, and Lewis audition the IFs, but he is unable to see any of them. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. After Bea and her father drive off, Margaret asks Blossom if the two of them should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her. One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door. At the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be all right. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. He inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack up to go home. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. Realizing Blossom was her grandmother's IF, Bea decides to test Lewis' idea. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. Some time later, Cal begins reuniting the IFs with their original kids, now grown up. Feeling unmotivated, Bea talks with Lewis on the Coney Island pier. Bea and her father return home, where he trips over Keith, his invisible imaginary friend. She suddenly realizes that Cal is her own IF, forgotten after the death of her mother. The landlady shows Bea that the door opens into an old storage room. Benjamin meets his IF, a cartoonish dragon with glasses. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. </PLOT_SUMMARY>"]}], "tstamp": 1755254967.693793, "total_output_tokens": 804, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip.  \n\nInterpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton in the theft and arrests him. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane.  \n\nTo do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield.

In anger, Dean tells him that he is Rod, not Ricky. At the hospital, the trio learn that Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker. When Rod gives the trio the impression that he personally knows Carly's ex, Gary Polisner, they decide to drug Polisner with a Ketamine pill, but the Rabbi eats the pill instead. Dean feels bad about how Rod was treated and apologizes to him, and this is when Rod gives Dean his business card. The fire spreads to the neighbor's scarecrow. Summerhayes asks Dean his thoughts, and they agree to the merger. On their flight, the trio turn off their phones, post something as 'Ricky', and write in their Bible of Ricky Stanicky, detailing all of what 'Ricky Stanicky' has done. Erin is heartbroken and says that it is too late for his apologies now. After learning the truth about Ricky, Susan tells JT he has to camp in the backyard for six months as punishment. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they make. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. But Ted is also impressed when Ricky displays his knowledge of Ted's upcoming merger with World River. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. While in Atlantic City, they meet Rock-Hard Rod (John Cena), an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky. Rod reveals that he legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and tells Dean that he is thankful for being given a new life. At the party, Ricky tells the trio that Carly is now his fiance, and that they are all going to work on cleaning the environment on the weekend. As Summerhayes is about to fire Dean, the World River executives approach Summerhayes and enthusiastically approve of his choice to hire Ricky, ready to agree to a merger. Ricky riles Ted when he calls him an old school banker who works to make rich people richer. Ted promotes Ricky as he believes Ricky tells him the truth. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name 'Ricky Stanicky' on one of their costume pieces, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank. Erin meets with Dean and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. Rod says that he cannot go back to Atlantic City as he will be killed for some things he did (including being in debt to some mafia types), which he doesn't remember as he was drunk. Erin states it will be difficult, but hearing Ricky's recording of Dean talking about his love and appreciation for Erin helps. Ricky gives his stamp of approval to the merger. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's 'Hero of the Week' segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts. The next day, there is a party between Summerhayes' company and World River, where they intend to watch the premiere of Ricky's 'Hero of the Week' segment. Dean gets a call from 'Ricky' (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. The 'Hero of the Week' story begins playing, and Rod tells the reporter about how he met Dean, and how the Ricky Stanicky Bible made him realize that he needed to change his life. At the Bris, Rod impresses everyone with his personality and knowledge as 'Ricky', including Leona, Carly (Erin's cousin), and Ted Summerhayes (William H. Twenty years later, the trio continued to use Ricky Stanicky as their excuse to forego life obligations and avoid getting in trouble. Macy) (Dean and JT's boss). During the credits, videos and pictures are shown with Ricky and others cleaning, Carly donating her hair to children, Wes becoming a published author, JT brushing his teeth outside near his Porta-potty while Susan and Whitaker watch, everyone posing at Dean and Erin's wedding, and a viral TikTok remix made with Summerhayes' comedic jerking motions at various conferences. The guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and share the same with Rod to bring him up to speed. Ricky also tells Ted that he has an 'Air-Dicking' habit when he gives presentations. In reality, JT and Dean received tickets to see Marc Rebillet in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Wes also told Keith that he dated Ricky (who he said was a bi), just in case he needed an out with Keith. The next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. Wes almost tells everyone the truth, but Dean pivots by saying that Ricky lied in order to celebrate being 5 years cancer-free with his best friends. Dean & JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives. At the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party. It turns out that Wes has been using the Ricky gig to score some alone time for himself (at the pot milk farm) away from his partner Keith (Daniel Monks). Leona tells the trio that Ricky is invited to Whitaker's Bris. Ricky uses Summerhayes' cigar cutter to complete the circumcision, causing everyone to celebrate. While Wes believes that it is time for them to come clean, Dean decides to hire Rod to play Ricky Stanicky. Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. Rod is a major mooch, and soon the friends tire of him and want to be rid of him. Ted realizes that nobody listens to a word he says as they are distracted by his mannerisms on stage. JT's mother-in-law, Leona (Heather Mitchell), does not believe Ricky Stanicky is real. Dean asks if she can forgive him. JT and his wife, Susan (Anja Savcic), are about to have a baby shower, and Dean and his girlfriend, Erin (Lex Scott Davis), have been setting it up. Summerhayes decides to start a charity organization per Ricky's suggestion and makes Ricky the head of the World River merger, replacing Dean. Rod has no idea about the merger and begins to record Dean to ask for advice. During the circumcision, the Rabbi Greenberg (Jeff Ross) has a reaction to the Ketamine, leaving Whitaker half-circumcised."]}], "tstamp": 1755255031.3155186, "total_output_tokens": 1481, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

Initially, they enjoy their time there until a confrontation with Kutty, a senior student, escalates, bruising his ego. In retaliation, Kutty and his gang forcefully take the trio to his place and brutally thrash them, only to offer friendship afterward. Feeling humiliated, Aju seeks revenge and leads his friends to multiple bars in search of gangsters, eventually befriending Ranga, a prominent, eccentric and kind-hearted Malayali-Kannadiga gangster who dresses in all-white.

On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage so her bride price can help their impoverished people. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy. The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices. After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. Elodie then interrupts the wedding of another sacrifice at the palace, exposing the Aurean royal family's treachery. The Dragon kills them, including Lord Bayford, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the Dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the Dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. </PLOT_SUMMARY>"]}], "tstamp": 1755255069.9598694, "total_output_tokens": 720, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious \u2018book\u2019 capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. Many generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova.

Prince Andrew's private secretary Amanda Thirsk believes the Epstein photo is a key reason the palace's event was not attended by the press. His lack of remorse and accountability on screen \u2013 along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and an apparent inability to sweat \u2013 is widely viewed as the public catalyst for the downfall of Prince Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole.

The tribe's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world, forced Shimo to trigger an ice age, and waged war against Godzilla's species, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping him and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suko's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Unknown to them, one of Skar King's loyalists follows them and informs him that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother. While observing Jia socializing with the Iwi, Andrews voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with her people and that Andrews would have to accept it. When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile named Suko. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. Skar King and Shimo manage to use one of the portals to escape to the surface, forcing Godzilla and Kong to chase them to Rio de Janeiro, and Shimo induces a second ice age at Skar King's command. After undoing Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and destroys the crystal controlling Shimo. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as \u2018Titans\u2019 \u2014 killing Titan Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards. Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth and engage Skar King and Shimo in battle. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. After a brief initial confrontation, Kong convinces Suko to lead him to the tribe's lair, and the two slowly bond on their journey. Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface. Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iwi's home and the portals. </PLOT_SUMMARY>"]}], "tstamp": 1755255148.686672, "total_output_tokens": 841, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

On the night of the intended raid, Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. With their supply and aid ships constantly sunk by German submarines, Brigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books black-ops sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation on the Spanish-controlled island Fernando Po.  \n\nMeanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command.  \n\nWhile waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission.  \n\nWhile SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats attached to it. In late 1941, during World War II the United Kingdom is struggling to halt Nazi Germany's attempts to take over Europe, with London regularly suffering bombing runs at the hands of the Luftwaffe. A montage of details before the end credits reveal the post operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels.  \n\nUpon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered. Although Luhr eventually catches on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip', the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head."]}], "tstamp": 1755255193.4631867, "total_output_tokens": 769, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

Vanraj reveals that he has hypnotised Janhvi through black magic; she will obey every command he gives.  \n\nHaving had enough and seeing Janhvi naked, Kabir and Jyoti attack Vanraj. Vanraj arrives at the farmhouse, claiming that his phone's battery has died. He torments the family by dictating Janhvi to do strange and cruel things, such as hitting herself, eating dry tea leaves, and attacking her brother.  \n\nAs Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death.  \n\nKabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children.  \n\nRealising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave.

Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparing them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good as God.  \n\nHe then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches.  \n\nIt is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother.  \n\nA year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive. With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. Earlier, Kabir had taken the home's security camera recording of Vanraj speaking to Janhvi, then spliced his words together to make it seem like Vanraj is ordering the girls to go back to normal.

She begins to suspect that the case against Zyair may be part of a larger scheme orchestrated by Ray and possibly other political figures, who aim to use the high-profile case to boost their careers. The situation is further strained by Kal and Azalia who vehemently oppose her involvement in the case, fearing the scandal could tarnish the family's reputation, especially as Ray prepares for a mayoral run. Amidst these challenges, a family gathering brings news that her brother-in-law, Ray Hawthorne, an ambitious assistant district attorney, is set to prosecute a high-profile murder case against Zyair Malloy, a charismatic local artist. Betrayals come to a head in a dramatic confrontation that exposes the deep corruption and personal vendettas driving the case. She faces threats not only from external forces aligned with the prosecution but also from within her own family, who are prepared to go to great lengths to protect their interests. In Chicago, Mea Harper, a seasoned defense attorney, faces ongoing marital strife, exacerbated by her husband Kal's infidelity and his mother Azalia's domineering influence. Complicating matters, Mea's professional interactions with Zyair gradually blur into a personal connection, challenging her objectivity and professional ethics. As Mea pushes forward, her relationship with Kal deteriorates. The personal stakes rise when Mea learns that Kal, together with Azalia, has been hiding crucial information about Azalia's health to manipulate her. Determined to see the case through, Mea arranges a clandestine meeting with a key witness who can blow the case wide open. Zyair, desperate to clear his name, insists he was framed, hinting at hidden motives behind the charges. Her investigation reveals that the prosecution's case hinges on questionable evidence, including a dubious video and forensic reports that Zyair contests. This meeting, however, ends with shocking revelations that force Mea to reconsider whom she can trust. Her resolve is tested as new revelations about Zyair's past relationships and his interactions with the victim come to light, painting a complex picture of the artist."]}], "tstamp": 1755255294.431576, "total_output_tokens": 560, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

The large contingent of heavily armored and mechanized second wave of Motherworld troops pushes the few remaining defenders back, destroying much of the village, but Kora and Gunnar use the shuttle and stolen uniforms to infiltrate the dreadnought, laying explosives on the engine. The fighters join the small group of villagers to harvest the entire grain supply in three days, so the flour can be used as leverage to prevent the Motherworld forces from simply bombing the village from orbit; over the remaining two days, Titus intends to train the villagers to fight. Over two days, Titus, Nemesis, Tarak, Milius, and Kora train the handful of villagers in combat, preparing a plan involving digging trenches and tunnels in the fields, laying explosives, and preparing Kora's shuttle. When Noble arrives with the dreadnought, his forces scan the village, identifying where the women and children are hiding, protected by Nemesis and Aris, and send forces to capture them to force Kora out. Kora and the surviving warriors return to Veldt, believing that Kora had killed Admiral Noble in hand-to-hand combat and prevented the forthcoming assault on the planet to claim its food supplies, but Aris, a Motherworld soldier working as a double agent for the village people, informs them that the dreadnought ship will arrive in five days.

They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker. Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.

Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Alin and Guney were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do.

He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him.

Disguised as a mute teenage boy, Furiosa works her way up the ranks of Immortan Joe's men for over a decade and helps build the 'War Rig', a heavily-armed supply tanker that can withstand raider attacks in the lawless Wasteland. Furiosa's mother Mary pursues them to the Horde's camp, killing all but one raider. However, Jack recognizes her potential and offers to train her to escape the Citadel if she helps him rebuild his crew. In a voiceover, the potentially unreliable narrator claims that Furiosa imprisoned Dementus at the Citadel and used his living body as fertilizer to grow a peach tree from her mother's seed. He orders Furiosa and Jack to collect weapons and ammunition from the Bullet Farm, an allied mining facility. During one such attack, the Rig's crew are wiped out, leaving its commander, Praetorian Jack, and Furiosa as the only survivors. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. One night, Rictus breaks Furiosa out of the vault to make sexual advances toward her; using a wig made from her own hair, she slips from his grasp and disappears. In the final scene, the 'Five Wives' hide in Furiosa's War Rig the night before another supply run. Upon arrival, Furiosa helps Joe plan a 40-day war, during which most of Dementus's horde is killed. At the Citadel, Immortan Joe imprisons Furiosa in the vault with his stable of 'wives'. For her services, Immortan Joe promotes Furiosa to 'Imperator' and gives her command of a new War Rig. The last raider delivers Furiosa to Dementus, but Furiosa mortally wounds him before he can reveal the Green Place's location. Furiosa becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; the two bond and resolve to escape together one day. Dementus changes course, using a Trojan Horse strategy to capture Gastown, an oil refinery that supplies the Citadel with gasoline. At peace negotiations, Joe agrees to recognize Dementus's authority over Gastown and increase its supplies of food and water in exchange for the Horde's physician and Furiosa. Immortan Joe decides to attack Gastown, as Dementus's mismanagement has led the facility to near-ruin. Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. Years after a global catastrophe, Australia is a radioactive wasteland and the Green Place of Many Mothers is one of the last remaining areas with fresh water and agriculture. However, Dementus, having preemptively attacked and captured the Bullet Farm, ambushes the War Rig on arrival; Furiosa and Jack barely escape, and Furiosa's left arm is severely injured. After an extended chase, she captures him in the desert. Dementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. Furiosa attempts to sabotage their motorbikes, but the raiders capture her as a prize for their leader, warlord Dementus of the Biker Horde. After receiving a tip from a stranded soldier, Dementus and the Biker Horde besiege the Citadel, another Wasteland settlement with fresh water and agriculture. They are repelled by the War Boys, the fanatical army of Citadel warlord Immortan Joe. She eventually meets Joe's five remaining wives in the vault where Joe once held her prisoner. Raiders discover the Green Place while two kids, Furiosa and Valkyrie, are picking peaches. Furiosa attempts to carjack the Rig and return to the Green Place, but Jack easily thwarts her. Mary stays back to buy Furiosa time to escape and gives her a peach pit to remember her by, but Furiosa returns to her mother anyway.

Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Shaddam surrenders, but the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, so he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. During another raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides.

How does a person capture an AI like Harlan that's always one step ahead? In the struggle, Smith is destroyed just as a recovery team arrives to save Shepherd. But, it's all been a ploy by Harlan to gain possession of the Dhib and its weapons to return to Earth and annihilate the population.

Atlas uses Harlan's captured number two Casca to discover its whereabouts, and convinces General Boothe to let her join the mission to capture or destroy it. As they approach Harlan's headquarters, his forces wipe out the ARC-equipped Rangers, leaving only Shepherd and Smith alive.

To learn more, he joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals that the orb was kept hidden by his grandmother within a brass-lined chamber. Lars Pinfield. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. Meanwhile, Ray and Podcast are collecting cursed objects for examination. Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, who has offered her passage to the afterlife. In a mid-credits scene, a trucker gets out of his truck to buy something from a vending machine, while the Mini-Pufts steal his vehicle in his absence. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian. After the group captures a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent, threatens to close them down with his authority as mayor. Garraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. After an argument with Gary and her mother, Phoebe runs away and takes Melody to Winston's research center. Ray suspects it is an apotropaic trap. To appease him, Callie removes underage Phoebe from the team. Phoebe reconfigures her proton pack with copper alloys to strengthen it; Melody, betrayed by Garraka, atones by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka. She uses his extraction equipment to project herself as a ghost for two minutes so the pair can physically interact.

K. Rahim's health deteriorates and he begins coughing up blood, but still motivates the team by delivering an inspiring speech. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Indian team prepares to play against Australia. Rahim agrees to it and decides to take only 16 best players from the team and leave out the rest, including his son Hakim, who had also begun to play for the team. At a party organized for the new team, Rahim and Roy Choudhary have a bitter exchange, where they humiliate each other. The match draws with a score of 1-1 and the Indian team fails to qualify. The Indian team goes on to win the match with a score of 2-1, winning the gold medal at the Asian Games. The federation removes Rahim as coach for the Indian team on the grounds that the team has failed to give a good performance for a long period of time. Rahim requests the federation to let him coach the team again and promises that if the team does not win a gold medal, he will not coach any team again in his life. Rahim personally speaks with the Finance Minister Morarji Desai and requests to let the team participate, explaining its significance. The Finance Ministry refuses to let the Indian team participate in the competition, given insufficient funds. Rahim also learns that he has developed lung cancer due to his excessive smoking and will not live long. Rahim decides to spend his remaining days at home with his family and has frequent coughing fits. Rahim then scouts for players from all over India and forms a new team consisting of Tulsidas Balaram from Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj from Hyderabad and P. The Indian team is pitted against South Korea and they face defeat, with the teammates blaming one another for their poor performance.

Neville goes on to score a hat-trick and the Indian team wins the match with a score of 7-1, leaving the Australian team in shock. The Indian team eventually secures the fourth position at the Olympics. Meanwhile, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plan to remove Rahim from the federation and make Subhankar the President. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami from Calcutta among others. Rahim requests for permission to form another team with new players. An Indian diplomat publicly criticises the decision of not allowing Israel and Taiwan to play in the competition, which angers the people of Indonesia, leading to massive public protests against the Indian team. Subhankar, who is now President, initially refuses but has to give in to his request as the other members of the federation give their votes to let Rahim coach the team, given the even poor performance of the team since the time Rahim was removed as coach. Rahim instructs the Indian team \u2018to make them pay for it\u2019 and they go on to play more aggressively, winning the match with a score of 4-1. In their next match against Thailand, Jarnail Singh, a player from the Indian team is gravely injured by an opponent.

Against Sammy\u2019s objection, the other three attempt to negotiate their release, but the leader of the militia executes both Bohai and Tony for not being American.

They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain.

Kuttan is lowered into the hole, but along the way, the rope with which Kuttan is lowered runs out, and police are worried that it is unsafe to go any lower as there might be low oxygen levels, and they are not willing to risk Kuttan\u2019s life as well. The locals also inform them that the specific area was off-limits to people for a reason and that so far 13 people have fallen into that hole and none were ever recovered, dead or alive.

They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gunaa was shot. They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Inebriated, high and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhash's family that he fell in a waterfall. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard. But soon one of the boys, Sixen hears Subhash's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. Initially everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. Though there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. Subhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. Meanwhile, rain starts to flood the hole. Scared even more, the friends reach the local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area. Kuttan is lowered into the hole, but along the way, the rope with which Kuttan is lowered runs out, and police are worried that it is unsafe to go any lower as there might be low oxygen levels, and they are not willing to risk Kuttan\u2019s life as well. The fire department and more police officers are also called into the scene. 2 years later Kuttan is awarded the Jeevan Raksha Padak for his actions. The locals also inform them that the specific area was off-limits to people for a reason and that so far 13 people have fallen into that hole and none were ever recovered, dead or alive. Finally after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. In 2006, a group of 10 friends from an arts club in Kochi leave on a trip to Kodaikanal in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, during the Onam vacation.
