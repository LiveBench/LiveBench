A few minutes later, Botic van de Zandschulp held serve to establish a two sets to love lead.

But for once in the 21-year-old\u2019s prodigious career, the well had run dry.

Having established himself as such a reliable performer in the biggest tournaments, this defeat marks the first time that Alcaraz has lost to a player ranked outside of the top 15 at a grand slam since the French Open in 2021, when he was 18 years old and ranked 97th in the world.

The young cricketer found himself in a situation that most spectators and empathetic individuals would have found difficult to comprehend. With the help of Joe Root, Atkinson had managed to drag England from a precarious position of 216 for six to an overnight score of 358 for seven. However, the wait for his century was agonizingly long, with Atkinson having to endure almost 15 hours of downtime.\n\nThe thought processes that Atkinson went through during this time were not conducive to sporting success. He was likely to have experienced a fretful evening, interrupted sleep, and a tight fist of tension settling in his gut. However, Atkinson did not let these thoughts debilitate him. When his pursuit of a hundred was finally restarted by Lahiru Kumara at the beginning of day two, Atkinson was in no way affected.\n\nAtkinson's performance was nothing short of phenomenal. He nudged the first ball down the leg side for four and followed that with an impeccable cover drive that took him into the 80s. By the time that over ended, he had also been given out lbw, but the ball on course to comfortably miss leg stump. Atkinson's inside edge bounced just past his stumps, but it was clear that he was in no way debilitated.\n\nSri Lanka were again ragged, as they had been in the final session of the first day. Lord's may be known for the exorbitant cost of entry, but in the middle, there were freebies. Bowlers offered meek invitations to send the ball scuttling over a lightning outfield. Atkinson added four more boundaries and a few more clips for the highlights reel before reaching his century.\n\nParagraph 4: Word chain\nAtkinson's century was sealed with a drive past mid-off that brought him to 103 runs off 103 balls. A couple of balls later, he absolutely nailed a pull, again off Kumara, with a great deal of class and perhaps a hint of contempt. Atkinson's performance was a testament to his mental fortitude and his ability to rise above the challenges that he faced. His century was a triumph, not just for himself, but for England as a whole."]}], "tstamp": 1755050431.5510185, "total_output_tokens": 491, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}

Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has been engaged in a dispute with X's owner, Elon Musk, since April, ordered the \"immediate, complete and total suspension of X's operations\" in the country, \"until all court orders ... are complied with, fines are duly paid, and a new legal representative for the company is appointed in the country.\" The National Telecommunications Agency was given 24 hours to enforce the decision, and each of the more than 20,000 broadband internet providers in the country must block X. The agency's president, Carlos Manuel Baigorri, said the order had already been passed on to internet providers, and he expects that probably over the weekend all companies will be able to implement the block. Justice Moraes also initially summoned Apple and Google to \"implement technological barriers to prevent the use of the X app by users of the iOS and Android systems\" and to block the use of virtual private network (VPN) applications. However, later in the evening, the judge removed the part mentioning Apple and Google \"until there is a statement from the parties [X and Musk] in the case, to avoid any potential unnecessary disruptions to third-party companies [Apple and Google].\" The decision imposes a daily fine of R$50,000 (\u00a36,800) on individuals and companies that attempt to continue using X via VPN. The deadline given to X to appoint a new legal representative in the country expired at 8.07pm local time on Thursday (0.07am BST on Friday).\n\nSECTION 2\nThe decision to suspend X in Brazil comes after a long-standing dispute between Justice Alexandre de Moraes and Elon Musk, the owner of X. The judge has been critical of Musk's management of the company, particularly his decision to allow the use of the platform by individuals who have been convicted of crimes. The suspension of X in Brazil is part of a broader effort by the Brazilian government to regulate social media platforms and protect its citizens from harmful content. The decision to suspend X has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the move as a necessary step to protect public safety, while others criticize it as an infringement on free speech. The suspension of X in Brazil is likely to have a significant impact on the company's operations in the country, and it remains to be seen how Musk will respond to the decision."]}], "tstamp": 1755050508.076913, "total_output_tokens": 536, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}

A complaint citing 20 instances of alleged research misconduct was lodged with the University of Washington \u2013 where DiAngelo is an affiliate associate professor of education and completed her PhD \u2013 according to the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news site that has published a number of similar complaints against diversity officials and staff of colour at US universities. DiAngelo\u2019s 2004 thesis, titled Whiteness in Racial Dialogue: A Discourse Analysis, uses the exact or slightly tweaked wordings of other authors without quotation marks or proper referencing, which is classified as plagiarism under the University of Washington College of Education\u2019s academic integrity policy. Though DiAngelo lists these authors in a reference section at the end of the thesis, in several cases she did not cite their names next to the relevant sections in the text of the thesis itself. For example, on page five, DiAngelo summarises an argument made in David Theo Goldberg\u2019s Racist Culture using similar wording to that which appears in Stacey Lee\u2019s Unraveling the Model Minority Stereotype: Listening to Asian American Youth, without an accompanying in-text citation. Lee wrote that Goldberg \u201cargues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should focus not so much on how true stereotypes are, but on how the truth-claims they offer are a part of a larger world-view, and what forms of action that world-view authorizes\u201d. DiAngelo wrote that Goldberg \u201cargues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should not focus so much on how true stereotypes are, but how the truth claims they offer are a part of a larger world-view that authorizes and normalizes forms of domination and control\u201d. Mike Reddy, a senior lecturer at the University of South Wales and a member of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education\u2019s (QAA\u2019s) academic integrity advisory group, considered this to be one of many instances of genuine plagiarism in the complaint. After reviewing all 20 examples, he said that \u201cthe frequency and severity would show evidence of knowing plagiarism of texts\u201d.

The landmark action targets the \u201csweeping book removal provisions\u201d of House Bill 1069, which required school districts to set up a mechanism for parents to object to anything they considered pornographic or inappropriate. A central plank of Republican governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s war on \u201cwoke\u201d on Florida campuses, the law has been abused by rightwing activists who quickly realized that any book they challenged had to be immediately removed and replaced only after the exhaustion of a lengthy and cumbersome review process, if at all, the publishers say. Since it went into effect last July, countless titles have been removed from elementary, middle and high school libraries, including American classics such as Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. Contemporary novels by bestselling authors such as Margaret Atwood, Judy Blume and Stephen King have also been removed, as well as The Diary of a Young Girl, Anne Frank\u2019s gripping account of the Holocaust, according to the publishers. ***\n\nSection 2\n\u201cFlorida HB 1069\u2019s complex and overbroad provisions have created chaos and turmoil across the state, resulting in thousands of historic and modern classics, works we are proud to publish, being unlawfully labeled obscene and removed from shelves,\u201d Dan Novack, vice-president and associate general counsel of Penguin Random House (PRH), said in a statement. \u201cStudents need access to books that reflect a wide range of human experiences to learn and grow. It\u2019s imperative for the education of our young people that teachers and librarians be allowed to use their professional expertise to match our authors\u2019 books to the right reader at the right time in their life.\u201d PRH is joined in the action by Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishers, Simon &amp; Schuster and Sourcebooks. The 94-page lawsuit, which also features as plaintiffs the Authors Guild and a number of individual writers, was filed in federal court in Orlando on Thursday. ***\n\nSection 3\nThe suit contends the book removal provisions violate previous supreme court decisions relating to reviewing works for their literary, artistic, political and scientific value as a whole while considering any potential obscenity; and seeks to restore the discretion \u201cof trained educators to evaluate books holistically to avoid harm to students who will otherwise lose access to a wide range of viewpoints\u201d. The publishers say the law has been used to remove books that are critical of the US government, including those that deal with the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and the history of slavery. They also say the law has been used to remove books that deal with LGBTQ+ issues, mental health, and other topics that are considered controversial by some rightwing groups. The publishers say the law has also been used to remove books that are written by authors who are not white, male or Christian. ***"]}], "tstamp": 1755050537.388295, "total_output_tokens": 633, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}

The workers want control over Giuliani's New York City apartment, estimated to be worth more than $5m, as well as his condominium in Palm Beach. They also want him to turn over personal property, including a 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL500, jewelry, luxury watches and sports memorabilia, including Yankees World Series rings and jerseys signed by Joe DiMaggio and Reggie Jackson.\n\nSECTION 2\nThe workers are also seeking the right to $2m in legal fees Giuliani says he is owed by Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee. They also want a separate order from the court allowing them to take control over assets Giuliani does not turn over. The move comes after Giuliani has spent months trying to avoid paying the $148m judgment he owes Freeman and Moss. He is appealing the defamation judgment and tried to declare bankruptcy, but the case was dismissed after a judge said Giuliani had not been transparent about his finances.\n\nSECTION 3\nWhile Giuliani has insisted he does not have much money, his continued high spending has raised eyebrows. \"At every step, Mr. Giuliani has chosen evasion, obstruction, and outright disobedience. That strategy reaches the end of the line here,\" lawyers for Freeman and Moss wrote in the filing. The workers are determined to enforce the judgment and are willing to take whatever legal steps necessary to do so. The case has drawn attention from the country and has become a hot topic in the political arena. The workers are hopeful that the court will grant them control over Giuliani's assets and that he will be held accountable for his actions."]}], "tstamp": 1755050713.4400942, "total_output_tokens": 375, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}

Initially, he had publicly backed away from multiple anti-abortion positions, which Democrats saw as hypocritical. Anti-abortion activists, on the other hand, warned that Trump's shifting stance risks alienating voters who have long supported him. \n\nOn Thursday, Trump made headlines when he said that, if elected, he would make the government or insurance companies cover in vitro fertilization, a type of fertility assistance that some in the anti-abortion movement want to see curtailed. Trump also seemed to indicate that he planned to vote in favor of a ballot measure to restore abortion access in Florida, which currently bans abortion past six weeks of pregnancy. \n\nHowever, Trump's campaign quickly rushed to walk back his remarks on the ballot measure, telling NPR that Trump simply meant that six weeks is too early in pregnancy to ban abortion. Trump's press secretary said, \"President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida.\" \n\nOn Friday, in comments to Fox News, Trump also clarified his position on a Florida amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution and overturn the six-week abortion ban. He said he would vote against it, stating, \"I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks.\" But Trump also added, \"At the same time, the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month. So I'll be voting no for that reason.\" \n\nSince the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, in a decision backed by three justices that the former president appointed, Trump has alternately bragged about toppling Roe and complained that outrage over its fall will cost Republicans elections. But Trump's comments on Thursday mark his latest attempt to apparently clarify and soften his stance on the controversial procedure. \n\nIn conclusion, Trump's shifting stance on abortion has left many confused and frustrated. His contradictory statements have raised questions about his true beliefs and intentions. As the election approaches, it remains to be seen how Trump will ultimately position himself on this divisive issue."]}], "tstamp": 1755050736.0754764, "total_output_tokens": 449, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}
