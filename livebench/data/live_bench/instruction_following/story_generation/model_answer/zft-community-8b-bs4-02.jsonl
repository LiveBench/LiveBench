This move, confirmed by Elbert Krasniqi, Kosovo\u2019s minister of local administration, was described as a violation of the Republic of Kosovo\u2019s constitution and laws. The closure of these institutions, which had been established to address the needs of the Serb community, has been met with immediate criticism from the United States. The US embassy in Kosovo expressed its \"concern and disappointment\" with the uncoordinated actions, emphasizing that they have a direct and negative impact on the ethnic Serb community and other minority groups in the country. This development has further strained the already tense relationship between Kosovo and Serbia, a neighboring country that continues to support the Serb minority since Kosovo declared its independence in 2008, a move that Belgrade does not recognize.\n\nThe historical context of the Kosovo-Serbia relationship adds a layer of complexity to the current situation. Kosovo was once a Serbian province, and the region was the site of a brutal war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in the late 1990s. The conflict, which ended with a NATO bombing campaign in 1999, resulted in the deaths of approximately 13,000 people, the majority of whom were ethnic Albanians. The aftermath of the war left deep scars on the region, and the relationship between Kosovo and Serbia has remained fraught with tension ever since. Despite efforts to normalize relations, including a 13-year-long process facilitated by the European Union, progress has been slow. The failure to implement agreements reached in 2023 between Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti, who leads the ethnic Albanian-dominated government, has further complicated the situation.\n\nOne of the most symbolic and contentious issues in the Kosovo-Serbia relationship is the Ibar River bridge in Mitrovica, which divides the city into a Serb-dominated north and an ethnic Albanian south. The bridge, which has been closed to passenger vehicle traffic for over a decade, has been a focal point of tension. Minority ethnic Serbs erected barricades in 2011, fearing \"ethnic cleansing\" if ethnic Albanians were allowed to freely travel over the bridge into their part of the city. This month, Pristina announced plans to reopen the bridge, a move that has been welcomed by some but remains a source of concern for others. The reopening of the bridge is part of a broader effort to improve relations between Kosovo and Serbia, but it also highlights the deep-seated mistrust and fear that continue to characterize the relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe actions taken by Kosovo authorities in closing the parallel institutions and the ongoing tensions with Serbia underscore the challenges faced by the country in its efforts to build a stable and inclusive society. The US and the EU have been pressing both sides to implement the agreements reached in 2023, but the path to reconciliation remains fraught with obstacles. The closure of the institutions and the reopening of the Ibar River bridge are just two examples of the complex and often contentious issues that continue to shape the Kosovo-Serbia relationship. As the situation evolves, it is clear that finding a lasting solution will require sustained effort and a willingness to address the deep-seated grievances on both sides.

He ended the day unbeaten on 74, looking phenomenal with the bat. It seemed like a first-class century was within his grasp, but he had almost 15 hours of downtime to deal with. It was impossible not to imagine a fretful evening, a night of interrupted, restless sleep, and a tight fist of tension settling in his gut through the morning. However, Atkinson did not let these thoughts get to him.

Sri Lanka was again ragged, and there were freebies in the middle. Atkinson added four more boundaries and a few more clips for the highlights reel before reaching his century.

The migration of the Phylloscopus, or leaf warblers, has begun and our observatory on the Kent coast has been catching and ringing large numbers of willow warblers and chiffchaffs on their way to their wintering grounds in west Africa and southern Europe. Today, however, there was a rather more uncommon warbler in the mist net when we went to check. From a distance it had the fresh yellow jizz of a willow warbler, but my ringing companion, a retired vicar, drew my attention to its white belly. It was a wood warbler, first identified as a distinct species by the parson-naturalist Gilbert White in the 18th century. He was the first person to discern, through careful observation of their song and behaviour, that the \u201cwillow wren\u201d was in fact three distinct species: the willow warbler, the chiffchaff and the wood warbler. White\u2019s clerical successor carefully extracted our warbler from the mist net and placed it in a small cotton bag.

The process was both delicate and precise, ensuring that the bird could be tracked and studied without harm. Each step was a testament to the dedication of those involved in bird conservation. The wood warbler, with its distinctive white belly, was a rare find, adding to the excitement of the day.

A complaint citing 20 instances of alleged research misconduct was lodged with the University of Washington \u2013 where DiAngelo is an affiliate associate professor of education and completed her PhD \u2013 according to the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news site that has published a number of similar complaints against diversity officials and staff of colour at US universities. DiAngelo\u2019s 2004 thesis, titled Whiteness in Racial Dialogue: A Discourse Analysis, uses the exact or slightly tweaked wordings of other authors without quotation marks or proper referencing, which is classified as plagiarism under the University of Washington College of Education\u2019s academic integrity policy. Though DiAngelo lists these authors in a reference section at the end of the thesis, in several cases she did not cite their names next to the relevant sections in the text of the thesis itself. For example, on page five, DiAngelo summarises an argument made in David Theo Goldberg\u2019s Racist Culture using similar wording to that which appears in Stacey Lee\u2019s Unraveling the Model Minority Stereotype: Listening to Asian American Youth, without an accompanying in-text citation. Lee wrote that Goldberg \u201cargues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should focus not so much on how true stereotypes are, but on how the truth-claims they offer are a part of a larger world-view, and what forms of action that world-view authorizes\u201d. DiAngelo wrote that Goldberg \u201cargues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should not focus so much on how true stereotypes are, but how the truth claims they offer are a part of a larger world-view that authorizes and normalizes forms of domination and control\u201d. Mike Reddy, a senior lecturer at the University of South Wales and a member of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education\u2019s (QAA\u2019s) academic integrity advisory group, considered this to be one of many instances of genuine plagiarism in the complaint. After reviewing all 20 examples, he said that \u201cthe frequency and severity would show evidence of knowing plagiarism of texts\u201d. DiAngelo, who is white, is best known for her book White Fragility: Why It\u2019s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism, which was published in 2019 in the UK. ***\n\nThe allegations against DiAngelo have sparked a heated debate within academic circles and beyond. Critics argue that her work, which has been widely praised for its insights into white privilege and racial dynamics, is undermined by these serious ethical violations. Supporters of DiAngelo, however, have defended her, suggesting that the accusations are politically motivated and part of a broader effort to discredit her contributions to the field of race studies. The University of Washington has yet to issue an official statement regarding the complaint, leaving many questions unanswered. ***\n\nThe case has also raised broader concerns about the integrity of academic research, particularly in the field of social sciences. The use of unattributed or improperly cited material is a serious breach of academic standards, and the fact that DiAngelo\u2019s thesis has been scrutinized for plagiarism highlights the need for stricter oversight and accountability in scholarly work. Some have called for a review of DiAngelo\u2019s other publications to ensure that they meet the same rigorous standards of academic integrity. ***\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, the implications for DiAngelo\u2019s career and reputation remain uncertain. Her books, which have sold millions of copies and been translated into multiple languages, have had a significant impact on public discourse about race and racism. However, the allegations of plagiarism could cast a shadow over her work and lead to calls for a reevaluation of her contributions to the field. The University of Washington\u2019s response to the complaint will be closely watched, as it could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future. ***\n\nAny other questions?"]}], "tstamp": 1755255924.937177, "total_output_tokens": 800, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

The Republican nominee for president in 2024 made the bizarre comments during a \u201cfireside chat\u201d on Friday night in Washington at the annual gathering of Moms for Liberty, a national nonprofit that has led efforts to get mentions of LGBTQ identity and structural racism out of classrooms. In a long, zigzagging and at times incoherent conversation, Trump ricocheted between topics including his parents\u2019 marriage, Scotland, his reality TV show The Apprentice, Elon Musk (\u201ca super genius guy\u201d), his debates against Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and his upcoming contest with rival Kamala Harris, whom he described as a \u201cMarxist\u201d and \u201cdefective person\u201d. At one point the 78-year-old reflected on the career of his daughter Ivanka, who was a senior adviser in the first Trump administration but has been largely absent from the campaign trail this time. She was \u201cmaking so much money\u201d from her fashion brand, he claimed, but then gave it up to join him in politics. Trump recalled: \u201cI said, you would be a great ambassador to the United Nations, United Nations secretary \u2013 there\u2019d be nobody to compete with her. She may be my daughter but nobody could have competed with her, with her rat-rat-rat you know she\u2019s got. \u201cShe said, Daddy, I don\u2019t want to do that, I just want to help people get jobs. She would go around \u2013 not a glamorous job \u2013 but would go around to see Wal-Mart, to see Exxon, to see all these big companies to hire people and she had hired, like, millions of people during the course of her stay.\u201d The co-founder of Moms for Liberty, Tiffany Justice, sitting on stage with Trump, did not challenge his extraordinary suggestions that Ivanka had the requisite experience to serve at the UN or that she was responsible for hiring millions of people. Justice did repeatedly press an anti-trans agenda.\n\nManagement of the event, which was organized by Moms for Liberty, has been criticized for allowing such controversial statements to be made without proper fact-checking or moderation. The group, known for its efforts to remove LGBTQ content from school curricula, has faced backlash from educators and civil rights advocates who argue that its agenda is divisive and harmful. Despite the controversy, Trump\u2019s comments about Ivanka\u2019s role in job creation and her potential for a UN ambassadorship have sparked debate about the influence of family members in political appointments and the extent of Ivanka\u2019s actual contributions to the economy. Critics have pointed out that there is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim that Ivanka hired millions of people, and that her role in the Trump administration was more symbolic than substantive. Nonetheless, the comments have added another layer of complexity to the 2024 presidential race, as Trump continues to court the support of his base with increasingly outlandish claims.\n\nThe event in Washington also highlighted the growing influence of Moms for Liberty in shaping the political discourse around education and identity. The group\u2019s focus on removing LGBTQ content from classrooms has been met with both support and opposition, with some parents and community leaders arguing that it is necessary to protect children from what they perceive as harmful ideologies. However, many educators and activists have condemned the group\u2019s tactics as a form of censorship that undermines the principles of inclusivity and diversity in education. The presence of Trump at the event, and his willingness to align himself with Moms for Liberty, has further fueled concerns about the potential impact of his candidacy on the country\u2019s social and political landscape. As the 2024 election approaches, the intersection of family, politics, and identity will likely remain a contentious issue, with Trump\u2019s comments about Ivanka serving as a reminder of the complex dynamics at play.\n\nIn the broader context of the 2024 presidential race, Trump\u2019s comments about Ivanka and his ongoing attacks on Kamala Harris have underscored the polarizing nature of the campaign. Trump\u2019s characterization of Harris as a \u201cMarxist\u201d and \u201cdefective person\u201d has drawn criticism from opponents who argue that such rhetoric is divisive and unproductive. Meanwhile, his focus on job creation and his claims about Ivanka\u2019s contributions to the economy have been met with skepticism by many who question the accuracy of his statements. As the race heats up, Trump\u2019s ability to connect with his base while navigating the complexities of the issues at hand will be a key factor in determining his success. The event in Washington, with its mix of controversial statements and political messaging, serves as a microcosm of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for the 2024 election.\n\nP.P.S The story of Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Ivanka and his appearance at the Moms for Liberty event highlights the ongoing tensions in the 2024 presidential race. As the campaign continues to unfold, the intersection of family, politics, and identity will remain a central theme, with Trump\u2019s statements serving as a reminder of the complex and often contentious nature of the race. The event in Washington, with its mix of controversial statements and political messaging, underscores the challenges that lie ahead for both Trump and his opponents as they navigate the complexities of the issues at hand."]}], "tstamp": 1755255959.8476214, "total_output_tokens": 1078, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

Sri Lanka had a grizzly time of it, shipping 427 with the ball and then rolling for 196 in 55.3 overs. At stumps, England were batting again, with the stand-in captain, Ollie Pope, eschewing the follow-on. The hosts closed on 25 for one. But even factoring in the shortcomings of the tourists, the overhaul Stokes and McCullum have instigated this summer had gained further vindication. There was no question as to the headline act, even if it came early in the piece, as Gus Atkinson, 74 not out overnight, sealed a maiden Test century just 23 minutes into play. Stationed at No 8 and having never tasted three figures in senior cricket previously, the 26-year-old was unflappable during this swift conversion, driving Lahiru Kumara for a sixth four of the morning and letting out a guttural roar. Stokes tipped Atkinson for runs earlier in the summer, and his eye for a player\u2019s attributes has proved pretty sharp these past two years. Atkinson is now the sixth men\u2019s cricketer to claim a spot on all three Test honours boards at Lord\u2019s, that 12-wicket debut against West Indies in July ticking off both bowling feats and his 118 from 115 balls here completing the set. The analysts had day one down as the lowest amount of swing and seam at Lord\u2019s since ball-tracking was introduced 19 years ago; a bit of context for England\u2019s total, even if it was Dhananjaya de Silva who opted to bowl first. It signposted the likelihood of needing to chisel out 10 \u2013 and eventually 20 \u2013 wickets on this surface, and not least for an attack that had lost its point of difference through Mark Wood\u2019s thigh injury.\"\n\nSection 2\n\"Stokes and McCullum\u2019s strategy of building towards the future has clearly paid off, as evidenced by Atkinson\u2019s remarkable performance. The 26-year-old\u2019s century not only boosted England\u2019s position but also highlighted the depth of talent within the team. The analysts\u2019 assessment of the day\u2019s conditions as the lowest amount of swing and seam at Lord\u2019s since ball-tracking began 19 years ago underscores the challenge faced by the bowlers. Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s strong start, England\u2019s ability to adapt and capitalize on the conditions has been crucial. The loss of Mark Wood to a thigh injury has left the attack without a key player, but the emergence of players like Atkinson has provided a much-needed boost. As the match progresses, the focus will be on England\u2019s ability to maintain their momentum and secure a decisive victory.

The band, known for their hit songs like \"Wonderwall\" and \"Don't Look Back in Anger,\" has made it clear that tickets sold outside of official channels will be canceled by the promoters. This comes as a response to the rampant price gouging on resale websites like StubHub and Viagogo, where tickets for the Wembley concerts are being listed at prices far exceeding their official face value. Floor-standing tickets, for instance, are being sold for as little as \u00a3807 and as much as \u00a33,615, while lower-level seats are fetching over \u00a36,347. In stark contrast, the official ticket prices range from \u00a373 to \u00a3151, with the most expensive package for the Wembley shows retailing at \u00a3506.25.\n\nThe band\u2019s warning was posted on X, their official social media platform, where they stated, \u201cWe have noticed people attempting to sell tickets on the secondary market since the start of the pre-sale. Please note, tickets can ONLY be resold, at face value, via @Ticketmaster and @Twickets. Tickets sold in breach of the terms and conditions will be canceled by the promoters.\u201d This move is aimed at protecting fans from potential scams and ensuring that those who purchase tickets through official channels are the ones who attend the concerts.\n\nConsumer law expert Lisa Webb from Which? echoed the band\u2019s concerns, advising fans to avoid the secondary market altogether. \u201cOasis fans are understandably eager to snap up tickets to the reunion tour, but we\u2019d strongly advise against buying any of the resale tickets currently popping up online at inflated prices,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only is there a chance that some of these listings could be scam attempts, but even legitimate tickets could be canceled, rendering them invalid, if they are sold outside of the official resale platforms or at above face value.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s 15 UK shows, including performances in London, Manchester, Edinburgh, and Cardiff, will go on sale at 9 a.m. on Saturday, while the sale for their two Dublin gigs will begin at 8 a.m. The limited number of tickets available through a presale ballot on Friday evening has already sparked a frenzy among fans, with many turning to the secondary market in hopes of securing a spot. However, Oasis\u2019s warning serves as a reminder that the only safe and legitimate way to purchase tickets is through official channels.\n\nAs the tour date approaches, fans are urged to stay vigilant and avoid the pitfalls of the secondary market. The band\u2019s reunion tour is a rare opportunity for fans to see Oasis perform live, and ensuring that tickets are purchased through official platforms will guarantee a memorable experience. With the band\u2019s warning in place, the focus is now on the excitement of the upcoming concerts, where Oasis is expected to deliver a performance that will leave fans singing along to their timeless hits."]}], "tstamp": 1755255981.9541826, "total_output_tokens": 619, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

But Enzo Maresca\u2019s hopes of bringing in a striker were thwarted by the club failing to prise Victor Osimhen away from Napoli. After another frantic transfer window at Chelsea, and a day full of uncertainty, there was some satisfaction for the club that they were finally able to find a new home for Sterling. Arsenal emerged as the main contenders for the 29-year-old winger, whose hopes of a move had been complicated by his \u00a3325,000-a-week contract, and his season\u2019s loan was confirmed shortly before 1.50am BST. There is no loan fee. Talks with Chelsea accelerated on Friday evening and Sterling was quick to agree to joining Mikel Arteta\u2019s side. Arsenal were keen to bolster their title challenge by adding depth to their attack. Sterling has fallen out of favour at Chelsea and has been told he has no place in Maresca\u2019s plans. He had been cut from the first-team squad and informed he would not play a minute for Maresca, who has said he prefers different types of wingers. Chelsea have a wealth of options in the wide areas, raising questions over whether there is space for Sancho in their squad. The move for Sancho, who has been linked with a permanent transfer to Chelsea, is seen as a way to strengthen their attacking options. However, the club\u2019s focus on finding a striker has been a priority, and the failure to secure Osimhen has left them with a gap to fill. Despite this, Chelsea remain optimistic about their squad\u2019s depth and the potential for Sancho to make an impact. The transfer window has been a whirlwind of activity, with clubs scrambling to secure the players they need. For Arsenal, the signing of Sterling is a significant boost, as they look to build on their recent success. The club\u2019s ability to land a player of Sterling\u2019s caliber in the final days of the window is a testament to their determination and strategic planning. As the season progresses, Arsenal will be looking to Sterling to play a key role in their title challenge. Meanwhile, Chelsea will be hoping that Sancho can help them maintain their competitive edge.

The organization announced it would limit its search to internal expressions of interest, sparking concern among disability advocates. Former disability discrimination commissioner Graeme Innes, along with 33 other representatives of the blind and vision-impaired community, launched a public petition and wrote to Vision Australia\u2019s board urging it to prioritize the appointment of a blind chief executive. Innes expressed his dismay, stating that Vision Australia\u2019s commitment to employing blind people is undermined by the scarcity of leadership opportunities at the chief executive level.\n\nSECTION 2\nThe open letter from the coalition of advocates highlighted the need for inclusive and representative leadership in organizations serving people with disability. They cited a 2019 survey by World Blind Union, which found that only 24% of blind Australians were in full-time employment, as evidence of the challenges faced by the community. The signatories argued that Vision Australia\u2019s decision to limit its search to internal candidates was hypocritical, given the organization\u2019s long-standing advocacy for the employment of blind people. They urged the board to reconsider its approach and commit to an external search, prioritizing the appointment of the organization\u2019s first blind CEO.\n\nSECTION 3\nThe signatories to the open letter included prominent figures in the disability advocacy community, such as Ron McCallum, the former chair of the UN committee on the rights of people with disability and senior adviser to the disability royal commission, and David Blyth, former Vision Australia director and founding president of Blind Citizens Australia. They emphasized that while Vision Australia is committed to employing talented blind and vision-impaired staff, those in current roles might lack the executive experience required for the CEO position. The coalition\u2019s letter underscored the importance of inclusive leadership and the need for organizations to walk the talk when it comes to advocating for the rights and opportunities of people with disability.\n\nSECTION 4\nThe public petition and open letter have drawn significant attention to the issue of leadership representation in organizations serving people with disability. Analysts have noted that the phrase \u201cwalking the talk\u201d is particularly relevant in this context, as Vision Australia\u2019s commitment to employing blind people is being called into question by its decision to limit the search for its first blind CEO. The price of this decision, in terms of public trust and the organization\u2019s reputation, could be high.

The Guardian reports that Athwal, who owns 15 rental flats, has been accused of renting out properties with black mould and ant infestations. According to a BBC report, nearly half of the tenants in one block of seven flats have to regularly clean their bathroom ceilings to remove mould. A reporter for the corporation also claimed to have seen evidence of ant infestations in several of the properties. One resident was quoted as saying, \"The ants are everywhere,\" pointing to insects climbing up a door frame. Another resident reported being threatened with eviction by the letting agent if they complained about problems in their flat or started claiming benefits. Athwal, 60, told the BBC he was a \"renters' champion,\" adding that the properties were managed by an agency and that he had not been aware of these problems. He also denied any tenant had been threatened with eviction. According to the Redbridge council website, Athwal requires a selective property licence to rent out the block of seven properties, a system he introduced in December when he was the leader of the council. The BBC claimed that a search on the council\u2019s public licence register does not show that the properties have a licence.\n\nSECTION 2\n<<Lessons in Winter and Climate>>\nAs the winter season approaches, the story of Jas Athwal serves as a stark reminder of the importance of proper property management and tenant rights. The presence of black mould and ant infestations in the rental flats not only poses health risks but also highlights the need for stringent regulations and oversight. The threat of eviction for tenants who complain about living conditions is a clear violation of their rights and underscores the urgency of addressing such issues. In the context of climate change, the struggle to maintain safe and habitable living conditions becomes even more critical. The story of Athwal's properties, with their hidden struggles, offers a valuable lesson in the importance of transparency, accountability, and the need for robust systems to protect vulnerable communities.

These changes suggest a shift in the demographic composition of the incoming class at Amherst College.\n\nSECTION 3\nIn contrast, the percentage of white students at Amherst College increased sharply, from 33% to 39%, while the percentage of Asian American students rose slightly, from 18% to 20%. This trend indicates a potential increase in the representation of white and Asian American students at the college, which may have implications for the overall diversity of the student body.\n\nSECTION 4\nTufts University also reported a decrease in the percentage of Black students in its incoming class of 2028, falling from 7.3% to 4.7%. The percentage of white students increased from 46.8% to 49.3%, while the percentage of Asian American students decreased slightly from 20.3% to 19.7%. These changes highlight the potential impact of the Supreme Court's decision on the racial diversity of Tufts University's student population.\n\nSECTION 5\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has also announced a sharp decline in admissions from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, making it the first major US university to release statistics on the composition of its freshman class since the Supreme Court's ruling. According to MIT's admissions department, the percentage of Black students enrolled this year dropped from 15% to 5%, and the percentage of Hispanic and Latino students decreased from 16% to 11%. These developments underscore the potential consequences of the Supreme Court's decision on the diversity of students at top US universities."]}], "tstamp": 1755256073.572361, "total_output_tokens": 461, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

The workers are seeking to enforce a $148 million defamation judgment that Giuliani owes them, and they have asked a federal judge to give them control over his assets. This includes his New York City apartment, estimated to be worth more than $5 million, as well as his condominium in Palm Beach. The workers are also seeking personal property, including a 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL500, jewelry, luxury watches, and sports memorabilia, such as Yankees World Series rings and jerseys signed by Joe DiMaggio and Reggie Jackson. Additionally, they are seeking $2 million in legal fees that Giuliani says he is owed by Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nSECTION 2\nGiuliani has been trying to avoid paying the $148 million judgment for months, and he has even attempted to declare bankruptcy. However, the case was dismissed after a judge said Giuliani had not been transparent about his finances. Despite his insistence that he does not have much money, his continued high spending has raised eyebrows. The workers' lawyers have accused Giuliani of choosing evasion, obstruction, and outright disobedience, and they have asked the court to give them control over any assets that Giuliani does not turn over. The workers are also seeking a separate order from the court allowing them to take control over assets Giuliani does not turn over.\n\nSECTION 3\nThe case has drawn attention from various sectors, including the country's legal and political circles. The workers' lawyers have emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in the legal system, and they have called on the court to take action against Giuliani's continued evasion of the judgment. The case has also raised questions about the role of personal property in legal disputes, and it has sparked a debate about the limits of legal action in enforcing judgments. The workers' lawyers have stated that they are committed to pursuing the case to the end, and they have expressed their hope that the court will take action to ensure that Giuliani pays the judgment. The case is expected to continue to draw attention in the coming weeks and months, as the workers and Giuliani's legal team continue to battle over the issue of the $148 million judgment.\n\nP.P.S.

Over the past two weeks, Trump has publicly distanced himself from several anti-abortion stances, a shift that Democrats view as hypocritical and that anti-abortion activists fear could alienate his core supporters.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced that, if elected, he would make the government or insurance companies cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), a type of fertility treatment that some in the anti-abortion movement have sought to restrict. This announcement came as a surprise to many, given Trump's previous opposition to such measures. Additionally, Trump seemed to indicate that he planned to vote in favor of a ballot measure to restore abortion access in Florida, which currently bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. \"I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,\" Trump told NBC News in an interview.\n\nHowever, Trump's campaign quickly sought to clarify his remarks, telling NPR that he simply meant that six weeks is too early in pregnancy to ban abortion. \"President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida,\" his press secretary stated. On Friday, in comments to Fox News, Trump further clarified his position on a Florida amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution and overturn the six-week abortion ban. He said he would vote against it, stating, \"I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks,\" but also added, \"At the same time, the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month \u2026 So I\u2019ll be voting no for that reason.\"\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a decision backed by three justices that Trump appointed, the Republican candidate has alternately bragged about toppling Roe and complained that outrage over its fall will cost Republicans elections.
