But Enzo Maresca\u2019s hopes of bringing in a striker were thwarted by the club failing to prise Victor Osimhen away from Napoli. After another frantic transfer window at Chelsea, and a day full of uncertainty, there was some satisfaction for the club that they were finally able to find a new home for Sterling. Arsenal emerged as the main contenders for the 29-year-old winger, whose hopes of a move had been complicated by his \u00a3325,000-a-week contract, and his season\u2019s loan was confirmed shortly before 1.50am BST. There is no loan fee. Talks with Chelsea accelerated on Friday evening and Sterling was quick to agree to joining Mikel Arteta\u2019s side. Arsenal were keen to bolster their title challenge by adding depth to their attack. Sterling has fallen out of favour at Chelsea and has been told he has no place in Maresca\u2019s plans. He had been cut from the first-team squad and informed he would not play a minute for Maresca, who has said he prefers different types of wingers.

A first first-class century felt within his grasp, but first he had almost 15 hours of downtime to deal with. It was impossible not to imagine a fretful evening, a night of interrupted, restless sleep, a tight fist of tension settling in his gut through the morning, swelling and clenching and twisting sadistically, and, after all that, it being something of a triumph simply to haul his body to the crease, prospects ruined by the moment\u2019s ripe potential and by being forced to spend so long pondering it.

The exciting thing for Villa is that, after half an hour in Rogers\u2019 company, it is clear he believes there is much more to come. \u201cI\u2019ve had to work on my confidence \u2026 so thinking that I can be the best player on the pitch at any given time or day, no matter who is playing.

Though DiAngelo lists these authors in a reference section at the end of the thesis, in several cases she did not cite their names next to the relevant sections in the text of the thesis itself. For example, on page five, DiAngelo summarises an argument made in David Theo Goldberg\u2019s Racist Culture using similar wording to that which appears in Stacey Lee\u2019s Unraveling the Model Minority Stereotype: Listening to Asian American Youth, without an accompanying in-text citation. Lee wrote that Goldberg \u201cargues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should focus not so much on how true stereotypes are, but on how the truth-claims they offer are a part of a larger world-view, and what forms of action that world-view authorizes\u201d. DiAngelo wrote that Goldberg \u201cargues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should not focus so much on how true stereotypes are, but how the truth claims they offer are a part of a larger world-view that authorizes and normalizes forms of domination and control\u201d. Mike Reddy, a senior lecturer at the University of South Wales and a member of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education\u2019s (QAA\u2019s) academic integrity advisory group, considered this to be one of many instances of genuine plagiarism in the complaint. After reviewing all 20 examples, he said that \u201cthe frequency and severity would show evidence of knowing plagiarism of texts\u201d. DiAngelo, who is white, is best known for her book White Fragility: Why It\u2019s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism, which was published in 2019 in the UK. ***"}
