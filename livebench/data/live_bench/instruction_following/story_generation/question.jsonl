The minister, Brandon Lewis, told the Commons home affairs select committee that an extra 1,200 UK visas and immigration staff were being recruited to process an expected 3.5m applications from EU nationals over two and a half years. He also told MPs on Tuesday that he was optimistic that an agreement could be struck by Christmas on the rights of EU citizens in the UK in the Brexit negotiations. However, he declined to comment on reports that the Brexit inner cabinet had decided on Monday that the European court of justice could continue to play a role in guaranteeing their rights during a two-year transition period. The Home Office minister did confirm that those refused \u201csettled status\u201d and classed as non-EU nationals in Britain illegally could have their bank accounts frozen and face deportation before the hearing of any appeal in British courts. The 3million group, representing EU nationals in Britain, immediately questioned Lewis\u2019s claim that an agreement with the EU on \u201csettled status\u201d was likely before Christmas. \u201cWe wonder how. Major stumbling blocks still in place,\u201d they tweeted, noting continued differences over the role of the ECJ, over family reunification rights that could affect thousands, and regarding clarification that they should not face \u201chostile environment measures\u201d. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, voiced scepticism that an extra 1,200 staff \u2013 of whom 700 had already been recruited \u2013 would be sufficient when the UK Visas and Immigration agency (UKVI) currently used 6,500 staff to process 3m visa applications a year. There was already a three-month delay in processing EU nationals\u2019 applications for permanent residence documents, she said.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat. Bogart is Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose tendency to violence and self-hatred isn\u2019t helped by the fact that he hasn\u2019t had a hit in years. Like the directors, producers and actors he occasionally sees in bars, his best days were before the second world war. One night at a restaurant, his agent offers him a much-needed gig adapting some brainless bestseller and Dix shruggingly accepts.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add \u00a390.5bn to the UK\u2019s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond\u2019s target of balancing the government\u2019s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be \u00a335bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR\u2019s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth \u2013 which measures the average output per hour worked \u2013 of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR\u2019s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 \u2013 almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 \u2013 still looked ambitious.

An amendment to the European Union (withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law was defeated by 313 votes to 295 on 15 November, and since then a row has developed as to what the vote meant in practice. Describing some of the reporting on the vote as \u201cweird and dishonest\u201d, Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted a clarification that the vote had been about the correct legal procedure for ensuring animal welfare standards \u2013 not on the principle of whether animals are sentient. Fellow Conservative Rachel Maclean, MP for Redditch country, posted a video to try and explain the confusion caused by what she said was \u201cfake news\u201d, stating that: \u201cThis government, and in fact all governments, are deeply committed to continuing to protect animals as sentient beings. That law is already written into our own law.\u201d Theresa May said at Wednesday\u2019s PMQs: \u201cWe recognise and respect that animals are sentient beings, and should be treated accordingly.\u201d Tory MP Hugo Swire republished on social media a letter he received from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the issue, adding: \u201cI do not believe that any MP thinks that animals do not have feelings or emotions.\u201d Nevertheless, the vote has triggered protests from animal rights groups, including multiple online petitions aimed at the House of Lords, UK parliament and Gove. Public figures including the presenter Sue Perkins have voiced strong criticism of MPs over the issue. Gudrun Ravetz, senior vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, commenting on the vote, said: \u201cIt is extremely concerning that a marginal majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause. This action undermines the government\u2019s previous promises that the UK will continue to be known for our high standards of animal health and welfare post-Brexit.\u201d However, Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, pointed out that EU law still allowed many practices across Europe that animal rights groups oppose. The amendment, proposed by the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, among others, had set out to specifically incorporate article 13 of title II of the Lisbon treaty into UK law. During debate on the amendment last Wednesday, Lucas pointed out that the origins of the clause began with the 1997 UK presidency of the EU and that from 1999 EU law had explicitly recognised that animals were sentient life forms.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Revealed by a report by Quartz, Google\u2019s Android system, which handles messaging services to ensure delivery of push notifications, began requesting the unique addresses of mobile phone masts (called Cell ID) at the beginning of 2017. The information was captured by the phone and routinely sent to Google by any modern Android device, even when location services were turned off and the sim card was removed. As a result Google could in theory track the location of the Android device and therefore the user, despite a reasonable expectation of privacy. A Google spokesperson said: \u201cIn January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery. \u201cHowever, we never incorporated Cell ID into our network sync system, so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated it to no longer request Cell ID.\u201d Google requested the Cell ID alongside what is called the mobile country code and mobile network code, which identify the country and mobile phone operator that the smartphone is using. That data is used to ensure the phone stays properly connected to Google\u2019s Firebase Cloud Messaging system, which handles the delivery of messages and notifications to the smartphone. A persistent connection is required for the system to work, but instead of staying constantly connected, the phone pings Google\u2019s servers at set intervals. The more pings, the greater the battery drain, so the data collected about the country and mobile networks is used to work out the the minimum number of pings required to stay connected without draining the battery \u2013 so called heartbeat analysis. The benefit of having the address of the mobile phone mast to ensure message service reliability is not clear, but through a process of triangulation \u2013 the same used to assist when a user is actively using location services \u2013 the position of the user can be revealed down to a roughly 400m radius at a minimum, and often much more accurately in urban areas.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It\u2019s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon\u2019s debut film Rumba, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It\u2019s a little gem.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.  Include keywords ['fire', 'meeting', 'quote', 'society', 'wheel'] in the response.

It\u2019s another piece of information that will help anyone making a serious attempt to understand the game and that is an indisputably good thing in my book. The reaction on social media has been, um, interesting. Some trainers appear not to think very highly of punters, judging by responses to the effect that punters will be terribly disappointed when they learn that many (most?) wind ops do not improve a horse\u2019s performance. Surely no one imagines that being told about wind ops is the same thing as getting the keys to the mint. It couldn\u2019t possibly be that, even if wind ops worked all the time. Let\u2019s imagine runners after a first-time wind op turned out to have a fantastically high strike-rate; that would soon be factored into the odds available, making it impossible to turn a profit by just backing them blindly. While trainers flatter themselves that their job is far too complex for us to understand, it seems that some of them have trouble comprehending how betting works.

Little, best known for his role as Anthony in the sitcom The Royle Family, accused the health secretary in a tweet of \u201cknowingly lying\u201d to the public about statistics and told Hunt to sue him if he was wrong.

That thread has been shared more than 15,000 times. The argument has since rolled on. Hunt on Monday replied with a series of 26 tweets of his own (although losing the chronology in the middle of the thread, making it difficult to follow). \u201cNow I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?\u201d he asked Little, referring back to his \u201clying to the public\u201d comment. \u201cTo fill the gap [in mental health staffing levels] we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25%.\u201d Hunt also quoted from a New York Times article from July, which has been corrected three times after the former shadow minister for mental health, Luciana Berger, challenged its contents.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

At a time when Ukraine has fallen off the media radar, this play by Natal\u2019ya Vorozhbit, translated by Sasha Dugdale, provides a powerful reminder of the bitterness of the war that led to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In particular, it makes the point that women attracted by the dubious glamour of the military can also become casualties of the conflict. The play consists of six vignettes of violence. The first is far and away the best. A Kiev-based writer called Natal\u2019ya tells the story of a research trip she made to the battle zone a year after the siege of Donetsk airport and how she fell for her patriotic escort. It is good precisely because it is personal, moving and filled with a double guilt: that of the confidence-revealing storyteller and of a woman who found love in a region where men were blowing each other to bits with rocket launchers. Later scenes show teenage girls eagerly waiting for soldiers, a female medic transporting her lover\u2019s headless corpse and a young journalist outwitting her captor.

The damning inspection report into Oakhill secure training centre, near Milton Keynes, was published on Tuesday as MPs heard that ministers had ordered G4S to set up an external inquiry into abuse allegations at Brook House, the immigration removal centre at Gatwick, which is also run by the private security firm. The joint report by the prison inspectors, with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, into Oakhill in September and October \u2013 when the centre was near capacity, with 75 boys aged 14 to 17 \u2013 finds \u201cno evidence that staff can adequately care and control this volume of young people\u201d. The report rates the youth prison as \u201cinadequate\u201d and says there has been an increase in fights and assaults since the last inspection in January; it records 330 assaults between March and August this year alone, with assaults against staff increasing, including against newly recruited staff, and some so serious they have led to people being taken to hospital. \u201cOne manager said that young people are carrying improvised weapons because they do not feel safe. This inhibits some staff from intervening because of the fear of a weapon, and this in turn reinforces the view of young people that staff cannot protect them, thereby continuing the cycle,\u201d the report says. The inspectors say that many of the recommendations from their January inspection have not been met and the centre has deteriorated in most respects, including to do with safety, care, education, resettlement and the \u201ceffectiveness of leaders and managers\u201d. They say that unacceptable behaviour, including swearing, intimidation and vandalism, is not being challenged by staff. Oakhill\u2019s newly appointed interim director, Lisette Saunders, said: \u201cWe take these findings very seriously.

In March he was cheered by his backbenchers after the UK avoided the recession predicted by many analysts following the Brexit vote last year. Employment was climbing and measures of consumer and business confidence, which plummeted after the referendum, had bounced back. But he was soon in deep trouble with his Tory colleagues for planning a one percentage point increase in national insurance on the self-employed and, in a humiliating U-turn, he was forced to ditch the whole idea.

He needs to push through measures that improve the economy\u2019s productivity to have any chance of meeting his pledge to eliminate the UK\u2019s deficit by the mid-2020s, but is also facing pressing problems in public services, welfare provision and a housing market that has effectively locked a generation of young people out of home ownership.

The hearing on Wednesday, six years after he was forced from office, follows his success at forging a winning coalition out of his centre-right Forza Italia and two far-right parties \u2013 the Northern League and Brothers of Italy \u2013 in regional elections in Sicily earlier this month.

In a recent interview with Marc Maron, Dwyer talked of his love of Scott Walker and, in particular, a scene in the Walker documentary 30th Century Man when a percussionist is recorded punching a side of beef; Dwyer has similarly tried to master new sounds, be it a flute on Thee Oh Sees\u2019 Dog Poison or electronic bagpipes on his most recent Damaged Bug LP. His career is full of examples of how to explore genres on a shoestring, too \u2013 there are projects that are just drums and vocals (the Drums) or a hefty death metal record squeezed out of three people (Dig That Body Up, It\u2019s Alive). We asked him where to begin in his vast back catalogue. Coachwhips \u2013 Bangers vs Fuckers (Narnack, 2003) Coachwhips rewrote the punk aesthetic for the 21st century. Raw, stripped back to the bones of guitar, drums and keys, their shows were chaotic and rambunctious. Bangers vs Fuckers epitomises that, squeezing 11 tracks into 18 minutes, and was notable for Dwyer\u2019s use of a telephone transducer rather than a microphone.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a \u20ac36.5m (\u00a332m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland\u2019s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed \u201ccomplete contempt\u201d for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. \u201cFinancial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,\u201d she said. \u201cTrees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.\u201d The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country\u2019s independent press and judiciary.

But when the Huddersfield contemporary music festival began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London. What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) \u2013 where the festival\u2019s tireless founding director, Richard Steinitz, was a lecturer in music \u2013 grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and Terry Riley to Hans Werner Henze and Elliott Carter. Gradually expanding its ambition and range, Steinitz\u2019s programming was never narrowly doctrinal; from the early days, he tried to reflect the spectrum of what was going on across Europe and the US. Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, Graham McKenzie, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock. With these changes, so the atmosphere of the festival has altered. This is partly because the generation of postwar composers whose appearances made the early festivals so memorable has all but gone, but also because, in those days, festival audiences had a sense of a shared purpose.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had \u201cabused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS\u201d by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than \u00a334m on the drug last year, up from about \u00a3600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from \u00a34.46 in 2007 to \u00a3258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to \u00a39.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel\u2019s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug.

The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee \u2013 a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotn\u00e1 became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers.

Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title.

McCall said the move was \u201ca technical, administrative thing\u201d and the airline had \u201cno concerns\u201d about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was \u201cprimarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market\u201d.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

White\u2019s clerical successor carefully extracted our warbler from the mist net and placed it in a small cotton bag.

Kosovo was a Serbian province before a Nato bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. Their war left about 13,000 people dead, mainly ethnic Albanians. The Kosovo-Serbia relationship remains tense and the 13-year-long normalisation talks facilitated by the EU have failed to make progress. A shootout in September 2023 between masked Serb gunmen and Kosovo police left four people dead. The EU and the US have pressed both sides to implement agreements that were reached in February and March 2023 between the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vucic, and the Kosovo prime minister, Albin Kurti, who leads the ethnic Albanian dominated government. This month, Pristina said it would open the bridge on the Ibar River which divides Mitrovica into a Serb-dominated north and ethnic Albanian south. The bridge has been closed to passenger vehicle traffic for more than a decade, with minority ethnic Serbs erecting barricades since 2011 because they say \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d would be carried out against them if ethnic Albanians could freely travel over the bridge into their part of the city.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

But on Friday, officials said, they had charged a suspect and were hoping that development would also help them locate the missing dogs, which are still unaccounted for. Paul Peavey, a 57-year-old resident of Idaho Springs, Colorado, was found shot to death on 24 August \u2013 days after he had been reported missing by friends and family \u2013 by a search party combing through his sprawling 110-acre property. On Friday, the Clear Creek county sheriff\u2019s office filed an affidavit charging another Colorado man, Sergio Ferrer, 36, with Peavey\u2019s murder and aggravated robbery. Ferrer was arrested hours after Peavey\u2019s body was found for failing to appear in court in Nebraska on a separate weapons charge, and had been considered a person of interest from early on in the investigation, according to a statement from the sheriff\u2019s department. Officials said they had accumulated enough evidence to support the charges but that the district attorney\u2019s office would determine the final charges to be filed. Ferrer, in interviews with police, admitted to shooting Peavey, according to an affidavit, but claimed he was acting in self-defense after an argument erupted between the two men over illegal activity. A member of the search party tipped off officers that Ferrer\u2019s family member had been selling doberman puppies on Facebook, the New York Times reported. Authorities secured a warrant and on 25 August searched Ferrer\u2019s home, where they found numerous items belonging to Peavey, including a phone, jewelry and metal detectors.

After another frantic transfer window at Chelsea, and a day full of uncertainty, there was some satisfaction for the club that they were finally able to find a new home for Sterling.

The national service provider\u2019s founding chair, former disability discrimination commissioner Graeme Innes, launched a public petition on Monday after he and 33 other representatives of the blind and vision-impaired community wrote to Vision Australia\u2019s board to urge it to prioritise the appointment of a blind chief executive. Innes told Guardian Australia he and the signatories were concerned because Vision Australia had for a long time argued publicly for the employment of blind people, but there was a scarcity of opportunities to take leadership roles at the chief executive level. The open letter referred to a 2019 survey by World Blind Union that found only 24% of blind Australians were in full-time employment. \u201cThey\u2019re not really walking the talk if they don\u2019t give blind people the opportunity to apply for the key role,\u201d Innes said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly hypocritical position for the organisation to take.\u201d The signatories wrote that they were dismayed to learn Vision Australia was limiting its search to internal expressions of interest. \u201cAs Australia\u2019s largest provider of blindness services, Vision Australia has a responsibility to ensure its leadership reflects the lived experience of our community,\u201d the coalition wrote. \u201cWe urge the board to reconsider this approach and commit to an external search, prioritising the appointment of the organisation\u2019s first blind CEO. \u201cThe final report of Australia\u2019s Disability Royal Commission underscores the need for inclusive and representative leadership in organisations serving people with disability.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email While they acknowledged Vision Australia was committed to employing talented blind and vision-impaired staff, the signatories said they were concerned that those in current roles might be \u201clacking the executive experience required for the CEO position\u201d. Signatories to the open letter included Ron McCallum, the former chair of the UN committee on the rights of people with disability and senior adviser to the disability royal commission, and David Blyth, former Vision Australia director and founding president of Blind Citizens Australia.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Amherst College and Tufts University, both in Massachusetts, reported a drop in the share of Black first-year students, an early sign that the high court\u2019s ruling could negatively affect racial diversity in the US\u2019s more selective colleges and universities, according to the New York Times. In June 2023, the US supreme court, driven by its conservative supermajority, ended race-conscious admissions at universities across the country in a move that dealt a substantial blow to the cause of greater student diversity on campuses, which critics warned would have far-reaching effects throughout society. The share of Black students at Amherst College for the incoming freshman class decreased by eight percentage points, from 11% last year to 3% this year, the data showed. The percentage of Hispanic students dropped from 12% to 8%. Meanwhile, the percentage of white students at Amherst College rose sharply, from 33% to 39%, and the percentage of Asian American students rose slightly, from 18% to 20%. Black students in Tuft University\u2019s incoming class of 2028 fell from 7.3% to 4.7% \u2013 while white students went up from 46.8% to 49.3%. The percentage of Asian American students decreased slightly from 20.3% to 19.7%. The data comes after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced a sharp fall in admissions from \u201cmembers of historically under-represented racial and ethnic groups\u201d last week, making it the first major US university to release statistics on the composition of its freshman class since the supreme court ruling. According to MIT\u2019s admissions department, the percentage of Black students enrolled this year dropped from 15% to 5%, and the percentage of Hispanic and Latino students dropped from 16% to 11%.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In one block of seven flats, nearly half the tenants said they had to regularly clean their bathroom ceilings to remove mould, the report has claimed. A reporter for the corporation also claimed to have seen evidence of ant infestations in a number of the seven properties. \u201cThe ants are everywhere,\u201d one resident was quoted as saying, pointing to insects climbing up a door frame. \u201cThey are on my kid\u2019s body and on their clothes.\u201d Another resident was reported saying they had been threatened with eviction by the letting agent if they complained about problems in their flat or started claiming benefits. Athwal, 60, told the BBC he was a \u201crenters\u2019 champion\u201d, adding that the properties were managed by an agency and that he had not been aware of these problems. He also denied any tenant had been threatened with eviction. According to the Redbridge council website, Athwal requires a selective property licence to rent out the block of seven properties, a system Athwal introduced in December when he was the leader of the council.

Congressional Democrats with military records and liberal-leaning veterans groups say the episode is consistent with past instances of the Republican presidential nominee flagrantly denigrating service in the armed forces. They also see it as an opportunity to turn the tables on Republican efforts to undermine the record of Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who has come under fire for a series of supposedly misleading statements about aspects of his 24 years of military service in the national guard. The US army rebuked Trump\u2019s campaign this week after members of the former president\u2019s entourage \u201cabruptly pushed aside\u201d a female cemetery staff member who was trying to prevent them taking pictures of Trump at a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of a soldier who was killed in a suicide bombing in Kabul during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The cemetery worker was acting in line with the facility\u2019s rules, which prohibits pictures or film being shot in section 60, the burial area for personnel killed serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. Pictures later appeared of Trump posing alongside members of the soldier\u2019s family smiling and giving the thumbs-up sign \u2013 a gesture denounced by some as inappropriate and crass. Trump\u2019s campaign also posted video footage on TikTok with the former president claiming \u2013 falsely \u2013 that \u201cwe didn\u2019t lose one person in 18 months. And then [the Biden administration] took over, that disaster of leaving Afghanistan.\u201d In fact, 11 US soldiers were killed in Trump\u2019s last year in Afghanistan. Trump was invited to Arlington by several of the families of those killed to mark the third anniversary of the Afghanistan withdrawal \u2013 the botched handling of which stands as one of the most damaging episodes of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.

It is the noise of the tectonic plates in Super League beginning to shift from one side of the Pennines to the other. For the last six or seven years, it has been Wigan and St Helens who have held the Super League title with a vice-like grip. There have been contenders, challengers even: but when the chips are down, it is usually the Warriors or the Saints holding the trophy aloft at Old Trafford every October. But now, 20 years on from the last first-time winner of Super League, it is starting to feel like we may have a new champion on the cards in the shape of Hull KR. Of course, this could all go wrong in the only six weeks of the year which really matter: just ask Huddersfield, Castleford or Warrington \u2013 all Super League table-toppers in the past, but failed to win the big one. Every week, we begin to wonder when the Robins will start to falter. Here, against a Salford side in fourth and hoping to reach the Grand Final themselves, that question was asked again. And once again, Rovers answered it emphatically with a destructive display which moves them to within just three wins of a first major trophy in almost 40 years. The biggest prize of them all will be won at Old Trafford in mid-October but for a side without a piece of silverware since 1985, the prospect of finishing top of Super League and claiming the League Leader\u2019s Shield cannot be diminished for this club.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Seemingly referring, when prompted, to NFL players who have expressed interest in temporarily crossing over from their 11-on-11 tackle football game to the younger five-on-five, contactless format debuting at the Los Angeles Olympics in four years, Doucette added: \u201cAnd whoever wants to come up with competition\u201d for the reigning champions, \u201cwe\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d Doucette\u2019s remarks capped off a four-day tournament that solidified how dominant the US has been in flag football even without resorting to household NFL names like Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Tyreek Hill, who \u2013 along with others of their ilk \u2013 all have spoken openly about their dreams of adding an Olympic gold medal to their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s during the next Summer Games. Coach Jorge Cascudo\u2019s US men went 7-0 in Finland, outscoring their opponents 370-111. Their average margin of victory was 34.9 points per game as the US captured the sixth of the last seven world flag titles dating back to 2010. Against Austria, Doucette \u2013 now a two-time world champion \u2013 delivered scoring throws to teammates Pablo Smith (twice), Ja\u2019Deion High (twice), Laval Davis and Bruce Mapp. The NFL\u2019s social media accounts even shared footage of one of Doucette\u2019s TD passes \u2013 a 45-yarder from his own end zone \u2013 to High, who once played on Texas Tech University\u2019s tackle football team alongside Mahomes.

Field Of Gold, a significant improver when successful at Newmarket last month, is a logical favourite butMatauri Bay and Royal Playwright (3.35) were winners of their only starts to date and Andrew Balding\u2019s colt could have the most scope for progress.

Beverley 1.30 Another excellent opportunity for the ultrareliable and progressive Quietness, who should grab an excellent opportunity to take her record for the season to five wins from six. Sandown 1.50 Impossible to rule out any of the 10 runners here with confidence but the fact that Michael Dods has booked Oisin Murphy for only the second time this year to ride Glenfinnan suggests that he could outrun odds of around 12-1. Murphy was aboard when he won over seven furlong for Balding, his previous trainer, last season and this is Glenfinnan\u2019s first step back up to that trip for his current yard. Sandown 2.25 A significant drop in class for Tamfana, a close fourth in the 1,000 Guineas in May and she will hard to beat if close to that form. Beverley 2.35 The bare form of Staincliff\u2019s wide-margin win at Windsor last time has little substance as the 1-6 favourite was entitled to win as she pleased, but Jack Channon\u2019s filly posted a very useful time as she did so and this step up to Listed company may just be a springboard on the way to even better things. Chester 2.40 Several leading candidates have drawn wide which could leave the way open for the consistent Carrytheone from stall five.

The four men were the only casualties from the strike, which hit the lead vehicle in which they were travelling. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described them as \u201carmed assailants\u201d who had hijacked the convoy. The incident has highlighted the dangers being faced daily by humanitarian workers trying to deliver life-saving assistance in Gaza, under the threat of looting and assault by armed gangs and desperate civilians, while risking coming under fire from Israeli forces on the ground or drones patrolling the skies. The convoy was organised by a US-based NGO, Anera, which has been serving refugees and victims of violence in the region for more than 50 years. It had partnered with a Dubai-based logistics company, Move One, to organise the convoy bringing medical supplies and fuel to an Emirati-run hospital in the southernmost city of Rafah. The convoy was on the way to the hospital when the lead vehicle was hit by an apparent drone strike. Its route had been coordinated in advance with the IDF, under a deconfliction process intended to prevent aid vehicles from being bombed. But, according to an Anera statement on Friday, shortly after the convoy had crossed into Gaza, four men from the local community who had worked with Move One before \u201cstepped forward and requested to take command of the leading vehicle, citing concern that the route was unsafe and at risk of being looted\u201d. In an earlier statement, Anera had described the Palestinian men as Move One employees, but on Friday it characterised them as \u201cfour community members with experience in previous missions and engagement in community security with Move One\u201d.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

But Zelenskiy spoke of the need to \u201cprotect\u201d the lives of those defending the country, suggesting the dismissal is probably related to the F-16 crash in which Lt Col Oleksiy Mes died. The arrival of the F-16s, donated by a number of European nations, was delayed due to the lengthy training programme required for pilots and ground staff to be able to operate the aircraft. Mariana Bezugla, a member of a parliamentary defence committee, had earlier claimed the plane was shot down by friendly fire. Reuters cited a US official stating the plane did not appear to have been hit by Russian fire, and the crash may have been caused by mechanical failure or pilot error. The crash was more unwelcome news in a week when Russia has continued to make rapid advances in eastern Ukraine toward the key city of Pokrovsk, sparking public criticism of the Ukrainian military leadership and Zelenskiy even as the bold incursion into the Russian Kursk region continues. For months, Russian forces have been attempting to seize Pokrovsk, a strategically important mining town with a prewar population of about 60,000, but their advance has gained considerable momentum in recent weeks.

Gus Atkinson ended day one unbeaten on 74 and having looked phenomenal with the bat in dragging England, with the notable assistance of Joe Root, from 216 for six to an overnight score of 358 for seven. A first first-class century felt within his grasp, but first he had almost 15 hours of downtime to deal with. It was impossible not to imagine a fretful evening, a night of interrupted, restless sleep, a tight fist of tension settling in his gut through the morning, swelling and clenching and twisting sadistically, and, after all that, it being something of a triumph simply to haul his body to the crease, prospects ruined by the moment\u2019s ripe potential and by being forced to spend so long pondering it. Clearly these are thought processes that are not conducive to sporting success, and evidently Atkinson did not endure them. When the wait finally ended and his pursuit of a hundred was restarted by Lahiru Kumara at the beginning of day two, he nudged the first ball down the leg side for four and followed that with an impeccable cover drive that took him into the 80s. By the time that over ended he had also been given out lbw \u2013 successfully reviewed, the ball on course to comfortably miss leg stump, Hawk-Eye\u2019s prediction greeted by air punches on the England balcony \u2013 and sent an inside edge bouncing just past his stumps, but it was clear that Atkinson was in no way debilitated. Sri Lanka were again ragged, as they had been in the final session of the first day. Lord\u2019s may be known for the exorbitant cost of entry but in the middle there were freebies, bowlers offering meek invitations to send the ball scuttling over a lightning outfield. Atkinson added four more boundaries and a few more clips for the highlights reel before reaching his century, sealed with a drive past mid-off that brought him to 103 runs off 103 balls, and a couple of balls later absolutely nailed a pull, again off Kumara, with a great deal of class and perhaps a hint of contempt.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

Sri Lanka had a grizzly time of it, no question, shipping 427 with the ball and then rolled for 196 in 55.3 overs. At stumps England were batting again, the stand-in captain, Ollie Pope, eschewing the follow-on \u2013 and then a nightwatcher \u2013 as the hosts closed on 25 for one. But even factoring in the shortcomings of the tourists, the overhaul Stokes and McCullum have instigated this summer \u2013 that switch from living in the moment to building towards the future \u2013 had gained further vindication. There was no question as to the headline act, even if it came early in the piece, as Gus Atkinson, 74 not out overnight, sealed a maiden Test century just 23 minutes into play. Stationed at No 8 and having never tasted three figures in senior cricket previously, the 26-year-old was unflappable during this swift conversion, driving Lahiru Kumara for a sixth four of the morning and letting out a guttural roar. Stokes tipped Atkinson for runs earlier in the summer and his eye for a player\u2019s attributes \u2013 rather than their back catalogue of achievements \u2013 has proved pretty sharp these past two years. Atkinson is now the sixth men\u2019s cricketer to claim a spot on all three Test honours boards at Lord\u2019s, that 12-wicket debut against West Indies in July ticking off both bowling feats and his 118 from 115 balls here completing the set.

Research published in the journal Science Advances has identified a doughnut-shaped region within the outer core, parallel to the equator. A study co-author and Australian National University geophysicist, Prof Hrvoje Tkal\u010di\u0107, said because scientists could not reach the core with current technology, the team had analysed the forms of seismic waves generated by large earthquakes as they travelled through it. They found the waves slowed down as they passed through a section near the ceiling, before the mantle. \u201cBy understanding the geometry of the paths of the waves and how they traverse the outer core\u2019s volume, we reconstructed their travel times through the Earth,\u201d Tkal\u010di\u0107 said. \u201cWe realised that seismic waves slow down in the zone that mathematically is called a torus.\u201d To most people this looked like a doughnut, he said. Understanding the outer core was important, he said, as it was critical to the survival of life at the surface. It was responsible for the magnetic field, which protected Earth from the constant bombardment of charged particles from the sun. Currents moving within the molten iron and nickel acted like a \u201cgiant dynamo\u201d that generated and sustained the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.

The role of lifestyle in explaining why the UK is an increasingly sick country, and the growing pressures on the NHS, is often underappreciated. Experts tend to cite the growing and, especially, ageing population, which are both key factors. But lifestyles do produce a significant amount of arguably avoidable ill health. For instance, skin cancer is one of the few forms of the disease where the incidence of it \u2013 the proportion of people getting it \u2013 is growing, and that is largely because of UV exposure during holidays in hot, sunny places. Cancer specialists estimate that about 40% of all cases of the disease are avoidable. In human terms that means that about 184,000 people in Britain will be diagnosed with cancer this year as a direct result of their obesity, smoking, drinking or history of sunburn, at a cost of \u00a378bn, including \u00a33.7bn of the NHS\u2019s precious budget. No wonder Keir Starmer wants to make lighting up even more difficult. A recent World Health Organization (WHO) report estimated that across Europe\u2019s 53 states a total of 2.7 million people a year die as a consequence of consumption of or exposure to four products: tobacco, alcohol, ultra-processed food and fossil fuels.

According to a court filing on Friday, lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss want a court to give them control over Giuliani\u2019s New York City apartment, estimated to be worth more than $5m, as well as his condominium in Palm Beach. They also want him to turn over personal property, including a 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL500, jewelry, luxury watches and sports memorabilia, including Yankees World Series rings and jerseys signed by Joe DiMaggio and Reggie Jackson.

They also want a separate order from the court allowing them to take control over assets Giuliani does not turn over. The move comes after Giuliani has spent months trying to avoid paying the $148m judgment he owes Freeman and Moss.

On Thursday, Trump said that, if elected, he would make the government or insurance companies cover in vitro fertilization \u2013 a type of fertility assistancethat some in the anti-abortion movement want to see curtailed. Trump also seemed to indicate that he planned to vote in favor of a ballot measure to restore abortion access in Florida, which currently bans abortion past six weeks of pregnancy. \u201cI am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,\u201d Trump told NBC News in an interview.

On Friday, in comments to Fox News, Trump also clarified his position on a Florida amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution and overturn the six-week abortion ban, saying he would vote against it. The Republican candidate had previously told NBC News that the six-week window is \u201ctoo short\u201d, sparking confusion about his stance. \u201cI think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks,\u201d Trump said Friday, but added: \u201cAt the same time, the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month \u2026 So I\u2019ll be voting no for that reason.\u201d Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, in a decision backed by three justices that the former president appointed, Trump has alternately bragged about toppling Roe and complained that outrage over its fall will cost Republicans elections.

The landmark action targets the \u201csweeping book removal provisions\u201d of House Bill 1069, which required school districts to set up a mechanism for parents to object to anything they considered pornographic or inappropriate. A central plank of Republican governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s war on \u201cwoke\u201d on Florida campuses, the law has been abused by rightwing activists who quickly realized that any book they challenged had to be immediately removed and replaced only after the exhaustion of a lengthy and cumbersome review process, if at all, the publishers say. Since it went into effect last July, countless titles have been removed from elementary, middle and high school libraries, including American classics such as Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. Contemporary novels by bestselling authors such as Margaret Atwood, Judy Blume and Stephen King have also been removed, as well as The Diary of a Young Girl, Anne Frank\u2019s gripping account of the Holocaust, according to the publishers. \u201cFlorida HB 1069\u2019s complex and overbroad provisions have created chaos and turmoil across the state, resulting in thousands of historic and modern classics, works we are proud to publish, being unlawfully labeled obscene and removed from shelves,\u201d Dan Novack, vice-president and associate general counsel of Penguin Random House (PRH), said in a statement. \u201cStudents need access to books that reflect a wide range of human experiences to learn and grow. It\u2019s imperative for the education of our young people that teachers and librarians be allowed to use their professional expertise to match our authors\u2019 books to the right reader at the right time in their life.\u201d PRH is joined in the action by Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishers, Simon &amp; Schuster and Sourcebooks. The 94-page lawsuit, which also features as plaintiffs the Authors Guild and a number of individual writers, was filed in federal court in Orlando on Thursday. The suit contends the book removal provisions violate previous supreme court decisions relating to reviewing works for their literary, artistic, political and scientific value as a whole while considering any potential obscenity; and seeks to restore the discretion \u201cof trained educators to evaluate books holistically to avoid harm to students who will otherwise lose access to a wide range of viewpoints\u201d.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

In a regional contest anticipated to be a battle between the centre-right and the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), a promise to raise the minimum wage helped the SPD win a direct mandate in every constituency. That seems much longer than three years ago. On Sunday, two high-stakes regional polls will take place in Germany\u2019s east, one in Saxony and the other in Thuringia. Then, on 22 September, it will be Brandenburg\u2019s turn. In each contest, the AfD has a good chance of winning, a feat it has never managed before in a state election. On issues such as migration, the politics of both the Thuringia and the Saxony branches of the AfD have been singled out as particularly extreme and anti-constitutional by German intelligence services. Separately, a self-styled \u201cleft-conservative\u201d party, led by a former East German communist, has emerged as a significant new disruptive force, eclipsing the more straightforwardly socialist Left party. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) is polling third in each state, after campaigning \u2013 like the AfD \u2013 for an end to arms support for Ukraine, abandoning net zero targets and slashing levels of immigration. Post-reunification, for cultural and historical as well as economic reasons, the political dynamics of Germany\u2019s poorer east have always been particular.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

A complaint citing 20 instances of alleged research misconduct was lodged with the University of Washington \u2013 where DiAngelo is an affiliate associate professor of education and completed her PhD \u2013 according to the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news site that has published a number of similar complaints against diversity officials and staff of colour at US universities. DiAngelo\u2019s 2004 thesis, titled Whiteness in Racial Dialogue: A Discourse Analysis, uses the exact or slightly tweaked wordings of other authors without quotation marks or proper referencing, which is classified as plagiarism under the University of Washington College of Education\u2019s academic integrity policy. Though DiAngelo lists these authors in a reference section at the end of the thesis, in several cases she did not cite their names next to the relevant sections in the text of the thesis itself. For example, on page five, DiAngelo summarises an argument made in David Theo Goldberg\u2019s Racist Culture using similar wording to that which appears in Stacey Lee\u2019s Unraveling the Model Minority Stereotype: Listening to Asian American Youth, without an accompanying in-text citation. Lee wrote that Goldberg \u201cargues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should focus not so much on how true stereotypes are, but on how the truth-claims they offer are a part of a larger world-view, and what forms of action that world-view authorizes\u201d. DiAngelo wrote that Goldberg \u201cargues that the questions surrounding racial discourse should not focus so much on how true stereotypes are, but how the truth claims they offer are a part of a larger world-view that authorizes and normalizes forms of domination and control\u201d. Mike Reddy, a senior lecturer at the University of South Wales and a member of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education\u2019s (QAA\u2019s) academic integrity advisory group, considered this to be one of many instances of genuine plagiarism in the complaint. After reviewing all 20 examples, he said that \u201cthe frequency and severity would show evidence of knowing plagiarism of texts\u201d. DiAngelo, who is white, is best known for her book White Fragility: Why It\u2019s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism, which was published in 2019 in the UK.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.
