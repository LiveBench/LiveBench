The festival likes to find room for the occasional domestic production in the main programme, a film that\u2019s happy to ride its home-turf advantage but is otherwise there to make up the numbers. Gianni Amelio\u2019s tense wartime saga is better than most but that counts for little when the battle heats up. It is 1918, \u201cthe Year of Victory\u201d, although in smalltown Italy it feels more akin to defeat. Alessandro Borghi and Gabriel Montesi play Giulio and Stefano, two childhood friends who work as doctors in a military hospital that has become a battleground of its own, toiling to patch up the casualties and truck them back to the front. Stefano is straight-backed, by the book, intent on freeing the beds as quickly as possible. Giulio, meanwhile, moonlights every night as \u201cthe Holy Hand\u201d, deliberately infecting and maiming his patients so that they might be sent home. Both men in their way are playing God on the ward. Each eventually risks regarding the other as the devil. Amelio is a 50-year veteran of Italian cinema and tackles the action with a robust, old-school efficiency.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Just as the flattening effect of algorithms means that coffee shops in Brooklyn and Bristol look the same these days, so it is with the bros. From Wim Hof ice baths to a diet of grass-fed beef, social media algorithms have created a tech-masculine ideal and tech-masculine lifestyle fuelled by the kind of basic strongmen they both seem to admire, chief among them Vladimir Putin.

The first minister acknowledged that SNP members had blamed the party\u2019s disastrous election result \u2013 plummeting from 48 seats to nine \u2013 on scandals such as the embezzlement charges against former chief executive and former health secretary Michael Matheson\u2019s \u00a311,000 iPad expenses claim. Members vented their anger and frustration at a private session on Friday after voters abandoned the party in July\u2019s general election for Labour\u2019s more compelling offer of change. Describing the session as \u201ca constructive discussion about a very difficult experience\u201d, Swinney told reporters on Saturday: \u201cThe main thing the party felt was that we weren\u2019t at our best at the election campaign.

Swinney was speaking before a challenging week, as the Scottish parliament returns from recess. The finance secretary, Shona Robison, is expected to announce deep cuts to tackle an acute spending crisis, having already imposed tough emergency controls on all non-essential spending. On a visit to Glasgow last week the new Labour chancellor Rachel Reeves said the SNP government was \u201cas guilty as the Conservative government of spending more than they were bringing in\u201d. But Swinney rejected this outright, saying: \u201cThe Scottish government has balanced its budget every year since 2007, a lot of them under my stewardship, so the idea that we have lived beyond our means is baloney.\u201d Swinney insisted that his government would balance its budget this coming year likewise, having already increased income tax for higher earners \u201cto ensure fiscal sustainability\u201d in previous years, but would be forced to make \u201ctough choices\u201d to do so.

In their undefeated opening three games, Forest have had 53 shots; Nuno will expect a greater conversion rate as his new charges gel considering the attacking quality at his disposal after another busy summer transfer window. For all the 10 new signings, however, Morgan Gibbs-White remains their most creative player.

It has persisted despite the rise of egalitarian and Marxist social theory and the advent in the 1960s of EP Thompson\u2019s levelling up school of \u201chistory from below\u201d. The Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle viewed figures such as Aristotle, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Martin Luther and the prophet Muhammad as standout heroes of their time who fundamentally, permanently changed the world around them. The mass of mankind, he believed, could merely watch, marvel, admire and tamely follow these top-down makers and shakers of \u201cuniversal history\u201d.

Nor was it his rightwing takeover of higher education, the banning of books from school libraries, his restriction of drag shows, or passive assent of neo-Nazis parading outside Disney World waving flags bearing the extremist governor\u2019s name that caused them to finally stand up to him. It was, instead, a love of vulnerable Florida scrub jays; a passion to preserve threatened gopher tortoises; and above all a unanimous desire to speak up for nature in defiance of Ron DeSantis\u2019s mind-boggling plan to pave over thousands of unspoiled acres at nine state parks and erect 350-room hotels, golf courses and pickleball courts. The outcry when DeSantis\u2019s department of environmental protection (DEP) unveiled its absurdly named Great Outdoors Initiative last week was immediate, overwhelming and unprecedented. The Republican Florida senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott penned a joint letter slamming an \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d proposal to build a golf course at Jonathan Dickinson state park in Martin county. The Republican congressman Brian Mast, usually a reliable DeSantis ally, said it would happen \u201cover my dead body\u201d. Scores of Republican state congress members and senators, whose achievements during the more than five years since DeSantis was elected governor have been largely limited to rubber-stamping his hard-right agenda, lined up to denounce the projects. Many noted the plans had been drawn up in secret, with no-bid contracts destined for mysteriously pre-chosen developers outside the requirements of Florida law. Thousands of environmental advocates and activists swamped multiple state parks on Tuesday in a day of action to protest against not only the ravaging of broad swathes of wildlife habitat, but DeSantis\u2019s lack of transparency and intention to limit public comment to only one hour at each state park during meetings that would be held simultaneously. By Wednesday, DeSantis\u2019s initiative was in effect dead, as the governor, clearly chastened by the unexpected all-quarters challenge to his previously unquestioned authority, furiously back-pedaled at an awkward press conference in Winter Haven.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

(Radio 4) | BBC Sounds I had mixed feelings about Radio 2\u2019s bank holiday Monday offering: a five-hour celebration of the late Steve Wright, made up of a station tribute hosted by Vernon Kay, a fan tribute with Liza Tarbuck, and Steve Wright in His Own Words, which delved into the BBC archives. Wright was a hugely loved Radio 2 staple, and the shows were the correct combination of warm-hearted and slightly cheesy (though, lest we forget, he\u2019d been moved on from his afternoon show just over a year before he died in February). The Kay programme featured some interesting comments from celebrity fans: Stewart Lee made a clever point about how Wright\u2019s 1980s on-air characters, such as Mr Angry, foreshadowed catchphrase-driven sketch shows such as The Fast Show and Little Britain (Lee: \u201cA character comes on and says that thing, and how long can you delay the gratification of them saying that thing?\u201d). I also loved the unexpected variety of music and pop star appearances that the archive show gave us: the Beatles chatting casually; the Bee Gees giving a spine-tingling impromptu acoustic performance. \u201cHe was always there for us,\u201d said Barry Gibb. \u201cWe\u2019ve done other interviews, but the only ones we really remember are the ones with Steve Wright.\u201d The fan show was full of love, which is fine. And I enjoyed hearing Wright discussing his personal audio influences, sharp as a tack on presenters and what they were good at. Tony Blackburn, he said, was a comedian, in the manner of a northern club comic: he\u2019d play a track, set up a joke, deliver the punchline and move to the next. Aside from all of that, I found much of the tribute madly uncomfortable, mostly because of the era it evoked \u2013 the 1970s and 80s, when Radio 1 was huge.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

It served high-quality meals at reasonable prices, attracted customers from the full spectrum of British society, and grew at a rate of 10 new sites a week at its most popular. The brains behind the operation? The British government, led by the prime minister, Winston Churchill. Churchill\u2019s British Restaurants, a chain of government-funded canteens offering nutritious price-capped meals, were intended to counter inflation in food and fuel prices related to the war, as well as to boost community spirit. At their peak, there were more British Restaurants across the UK than there are branches of McDonald\u2019s or Wetherspoons today. Now a new report is calling for the return of a \u201cnational restaurant service\u201d in some form, as a way to tackle contemporary issues such as health inequality, food insecurity and even climate change in the UK. A forthcoming report entitled Public diners: the idea whose time has come, by food policy NGO Nourish Scotland, marks the beginning of a campaign to introduce restaurants as a new piece of national infrastructure, a call backed by politicians and experts. A public diner, according to the report, is a state-subsidised eatery serving quality and ethically produced food at affordable prices.

Two possibilities sprang immediately to mind. One was the people who wrote the code \u2013 coders \u2013 long depicted in pop culture as a clan of vaguely comic, Tolkien-worshipping misfits. Another was the uber-capitalist system within which many worked, exemplified by the profoundly weird Silicon Valley.

There was also a third possibility, one I barely dared contemplate because the prospect of it was so appalling.

Greer\u2019s challenge was immediately taken up by Patrick Collison, co-founder with his brother, John, of the fintech giant Stripe (market value $65bn) and thus among the richest Irishmen in history. Unusually among tech titans, Collison is a passionate advocate of reading, and so it was perhaps predictable that he would produce a list of 43 books \u2013 adding a caveat that it wasn\u2019t \u201cthe list of books that I think one ought to read \u2013 it\u2019s just the list that I think roughly covers the major ideas that are influential here\u201d.

The list attracted a lot of attention, as lists often do. Marc Andreessen, the fabulously rich, opinionated crypto enthusiast (and, now, Donald Trump supporter) decried it as \u201caspirational\u201d; the \u201creal\u201d list, he maintained, simply consisted of Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s oeuvre, Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s Sapiens and \u201cassorted DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] training manuals\u201d.

Millions of Brazilian X users found themselves unable to access the network on Saturday morning as internet providers and mobile phone companies began to enforce the ban. When the Guardian tried to access the network on its computer and mobile phone, it received a message reading: \u201cSeems like you lost connectivity.

Bluesky\u2019s new members included Felipe Neto, one of Brazil\u2019s top social media influencers with more than 17 million X followers. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, when you go to another country, you\u2019re obliged to follow its legislation, even if you disagree with it,\u201d Neto wrote.

Musk, who has aligned himself with rightwing figures including Bolsonaro and his US ally Donald Trump, pushed back, accusing Moraes of squelching free speech and trying to censor conservative views.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Gormley and his artist partner, Vicken Parsons, who live in the nearby Gasholders building, said in a submission to Camden council in London: \u201cWe object to the destruction of the beautiful, unusually shaped, historic space of the yard.\u201d They said that the plan \u201crepresents a lack of imagination, a lazy solution in a place that deserves more\u201d and that \u201cwe will be left with something that feels sad and broken\u201d. Coal Drops Yard is a former industrial site which, with its proximity to the railway and canal, was used to receive and send coal around Britain, as well as goods such as grain and potatoes. It was redesigned by Thomas Heatherwick, opening to the public in 2018. It features Heatherwick\u2019s so-called kissing roofs, but also preserves the history of the yard, which was designed by King\u2019s Cross station architect Lewis Cubitt in the mid-19th century. New plans propose a pavilion-style building that would divide the coal yard into narrower shopping streets, containing \u201caccessible retail\u201d and a \u201cgrab-and-go offer\u201d. Anthea Harries, asset management director at Related Argent, the developer behind Coal Drops Yard, said in a statement: \u201cTo remain relevant, we must continue to adapt and diversify the range of shops to serve an evolving community of residents, workers and visitors.\u201d The King\u2019s Cross area has just been shortlisted for the prestigious Riba Stirling prize, for its transformation from a site of abandoned buildings and nightlife spots to a residential area with 1,700 new homes and five public squares. The Riba awards jury praised the redevelopment\u2019s \u201cprinciples for a human city\u201d and \u201csense of belonging\u201d as well as the preservation of open spaces and the fact that \u201cthe site\u2019s history (coal drops, gasometers) is celebrated and integrated\u201d.

Co-directed by Ludovic and Zoran Boukherma from Nicolas Mathieu\u2019s bestselling novel, this is a state-of-the-nation drama dressed up as a coming-of-age tale (or possibly vice-versa); it is at once intimate and expansive in the way in which it connects the low-rise estates to the posh homes on the hill. It also brings a dose of dirty social-realism to this year\u2019s Venice film festival. The time-frame is the 90s, although its socio-economic tensions still apply, just as the (fictional) burg of Heillange is broadly representative of a thousand other towns in France and elsewhere; living in the shadow of its shuttered steelworks and inhabited by too many people with too little to do. Heillange, we are told, is \u201ca town of hard times\u201d, where the big local news is the opening of an indoor ski slope. The white ex-steelworkers live in humdrum terraced houses and the immigrant ex-steelworkers live in the humdrum block of flats down the road. Neither camp evidently has much to do with the other until a minor crisis triggers a chain reaction. Our tour guide of sorts is gauche Anthony (wonderfully embodied by Paul Kircher), who is 14 years old at the start of the tale. One night he takes his dad\u2019s motorbike and rides out of town to a party, forlornly hoping to impress beautiful, middle-class Steph (Angelina Voreth).

With his side leading thanks to Kai Havertz\u2019s sublime lob, the Arsenal manager could have been forgiven for thinking they were on their way to a third comfortable victory in a row to start the new campaign after securing the surprise loan signing of Raheem Sterling from Chelsea on deadline day. Yet four minutes of the second half had been played when disaster struck as Declan Rice was sent off for a bizarre moment when he tangled with Brighton\u2019s Jo\u00ebl Veltman as he tried to take a free-kick. J\u00f5ao Pedro went on to equalise for Brighton as they kept pace with Arsenal and maintained their unbeaten record despite both sides having their chances to claim all three points late on. But it was Rice\u2019s second yellow card and then a red \u2013 the first of his Premier League career that means he will miss the north London derby after the international break \u2013 that proved the game\u2019s turning point. The referee, Chris Kavanagh, left the pitch to boos from the home fans and facing lots of questions from a furious Arteta having failed to keep control of a fiery contest. There had been an extra loud cheer before kick-off when Sterling\u2019s name was announced along with fellow new Arsenal signings Mikel Merino and goalkeeper Neto. Arteta had hoped that Merino, the Spain midfielder, could have been on the bench until he suffered an unfortunate shoulder injury during his first training session on Thursday, but he had to settle for a seat in the stands alongside Sterling, who was not registered in time to feature. Several of Brighton\u2019s new arrivals have also been sidelined, with the Turkey defender Ferdi Kadioglu ruled out after picking up an injury in training on Friday. That meant Jack Hinshelwood continued to deputise at left-back and he needed a pep talk from Fabian H\u00fcrzeler after 15 minutes of being run ragged by Bukayo Saka when a crestfallen James Milner had to limp off.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

But when it comes to marital traditions, trends appear to be moving in a different direction. Traditionally in the Swedish church, which is Lutheran, the bride and groom walk down the aisle together rather than the bride being accompanied by her father, as is often the case in Britain and the US. But in recent years \u2013 perhaps inspired by the influence of global television, films and social media \u2013 more Swedish women are requesting to be \u201chanded over\u201d by their fathers. The issue of what some Swedes describe as \u201cthe Hollywood tradition\u201d has been simmering for some time \u2013 particularly in 2010, when Sweden\u2019s crown princess, Victoria, decided to be partly walked down the aisle by her father, King Carl Gustaf. In recent days, the debate has reignited after a motion was submitted to the autumn meeting of the Swedish church to ban the practice of fathers handing over their daughters at the altar. Sara Waldenfors, a pastor in Nyl\u00f6se, Gothenburg, who along with Jesper Eneroth put forward the proposal for a ban, said there was no escaping the patriarchal symbolism. \u201cThe relatively new trend that the father walks the bride down the aisle and passes her over to her new husband is not in our church tradition,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cEven though the scene feels nice for future bridal couples, we can\u2019t disregard what it symbolises: a father handing over a minor virgin to her new guardian.\u201d According to Swedish tradition, the bride and groom walk down the aisle together. Currently the decision over whether or not a bride can walk down the aisle with her father is down to individual priests.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine Evidence, examined survey data of more than 4,000 women who reported tubal ligations, the formal term for a range of surgeries that clamp or remove fallopian tubes.

Enzo Maresca, Chelsea\u2019s new head coach, had asked for two positions to be strengthened before the end of the transfer window. He wanted a centre-back and a top No 9. After months of flirting with the idea, Chelsea were willing to throw everything they had at landing the Napoli striker Victor Osimhen. Late on Friday night, though, the recruitment team had to admit defeat in their attempt to convince Osimhen to fit into Chelsea\u2019s wage structure. There was no new centre-back either, although there was still a flurry of activity. Jadon Sancho was signed from Manchester United on loan with an obligation to buy and will compete with Pedro Neto, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Christopher Nkunku and Mykhailo Mudryk for a place in attacking midfield. Raheem Sterling, who was told there was not enough room for him on the flanks, was hastily loaned to Arsenal. The wisdom of those deals, along with the departures of academy products such as Conor Gallagher and Trevoh Chalobah, will only become clear in time.

The Cook Islands government was left with a debt of $120m and was almost bankrupted.

Palaszczuk\u2019s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary. The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, was unable to answer \u201cyes or no\u201d to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for \u201cpass\u201d.

Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting \u201ceasy narratives\u201d devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia. \u201cIn a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others \u2013 and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.\u201d Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large. He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions. The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters \u2013 a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney\u2019s west. Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges \u2013 a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes. He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes \u2013 seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm. \u201cTo suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no \u2013 and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians \u2013 is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,\u201d the race commissioner said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Nevertheless, on the surface, his decision to leave the Socceroos a week after overseeing their qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.

Medics are so scared of being complained about that they are also giving patients more tests than their symptoms merit and not performing procedures that involve more risk than usual. Four out of five doctors who become the subject of a complaint find the experience so stressful that they start practising more \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d than before, according to a survey of 6,144 doctors in Britain about whom a patient, relative or colleague had complained. \u201cThis involved \u2018hedging\u2019, which includes performing more tests than necessary, over-referral and overprescribing as well as \u2018avoidance\u2019, which includes avoiding procedures, not accepting high-risk patients or abandoning procedures early,\u201d according to research by a team led by Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London, whose findings have been published in the journal BMJ Open. \u201cThese behaviours may have a serious impact on patient care,\u201d they warned. While litigation, complaints and investigations are intended to protect patients from poor care and medical negligence, the \u201cburden and stress associated with these processes are clearly having unintended consequences and it may be argued that when examined as a whole, these structures may be causing more harm to patient care than good,\u201d the study said. \u201cWhile the regulatory system may protect patients from the misconduct of a relatively small number of doctors, it has a perverse effect on the majority of doctors who become preoccupied by defensive practice,\u201d it added.

Labor and the Greens want more renewables, while the Liberal National party and One Nation are pushing for a new coal-fired power station. The disputes are not over the desirability of public ownership (both sides support it). Nor are they, in any serious sense, about electricity prices (no one can reduce them by much). They aren\u2019t even about jobs, or rather, they are more about what kinds of jobs we want to create than about the number that will be created. Paradoxically, the closest parallel to the current debate is not over energy or economics it all. Rather it is the bitter culture war over equal marriage. Faced with a trend which has swept almost the entire developed world and seems certain to prevail everywhere in time, the supporters of coal are seeking to delay the inevitable. As part of the global push to reduce CO2 emissions, investment in renewable solar and wind power has soared, while coal-fired power is disappearing from most countries in the developed world.

At a press conference in Adelaide on Wednesday, Kakoschke-Moore announced she had received advice from the UK Home Office on Friday, confirmed by a specialist barrister, that she had received British citizenship from her mother, who was born in Singapore in 1957. Kakoschke-Moore had always believed she was not British because her father had received advice from the British embassy in Oman she was not eligible for citizenship when she was 12. She said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to discover she was British, which she described as \u201cextremely surprising\u201d because she \u201chad no reason to believe I was a British citizen until that point\u201d. Kakoschke-Moore explained that her mother was born in Singapore, a former British colony, which gave her \u201ccitizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies\u201d and became a British citizen in 1983 when the British Nationality Act came into effect. Kakoschke-Moore, born in Darwin in 1985, then gained that citizenship by descent.

A recount of the 2016 Senate election would likely elect the NXT candidate Tim Storrer, who unsuccessfully attempted to replace Xenophon in the Senate by challenging the party\u2019s chosen successor. Xenophon said he and his colleagues were \u201cdevastated\u201d by the loss of Kakoschke-Moore from the Senate, but predicted it was \u201cnot the end of her political career\u201d. Xenophon said the party had preliminary legal advice the position may not be filled by a recount, claiming the situation was \u201cuncharted legal territory\u201d because of the high court\u2019s recent decision involving Hollie Hughes.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Ruddock has been asked to report by 31 March. Turnbull said a variety of proposals for legislative changes to protect freedom of religion have been put forward in recent months but many of them go beyond the immediate issue of marriage, and parliament needed to be wary of them. \u201cAny reforms to protect religious freedom at large should be undertaken carefully,\u201d he said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThere is a high risk of unintended consequences when parliament attempts to legislate protections for basic rights and freedoms, such as freedom of religion.

When it comes to sports, Trump\u2019s targets are often African American, and he pursued a few such targets this week. Regular readers may remember that when last week the president asked China to free three UCLA basketball players accused of shoplifting, his main concern was that the players would thank him, which they did. But when LaVar Ball, the father of one of the arrested players and an inveterate attention seeker himself, questioned just how critical a role Trump actually played, it enraged the president. \u201cI should have left them in jail!\u201d he tweeted on Sunday, adding six hours later that he \u201cshould have gotten his son [LiAngelo Ball] out during my next trip to China instead \u2026 Very ungrateful!\u201d Trump \u2013 whose sons Donald Jr and Eric are well-known hunters \u2013 also gave more clues about his perhaps surprisingly critical views on the US Fish and Wildlife Service plan to allow imports of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, tweeting: \u201cBig-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.\u201d Monday Returning to his racially tinged offensive, Trump singled out Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders for sitting down during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner. \u201cGreat disrespect!\u201d tweeted the president, adding another dog whistle for the base when he pointed out that Lynch had stood up \u201cfor the Mexican anthem\u201d.

Tuesday Sexual misconduct accusations against the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore are a less divisive issue, at least outside Alabama \u2013 Moore has been condemned widely, including by numerous GOP figures.

Two of her best and most memorable works, which reveal her father\u2019s influence, are a striking self-portrait from 1954, and a 1957 portrait of Stanley himself. She had three solo shows of her paintings in London, and contributed to many mixed exhibitions, from the London Group to the Royal Academy shows. The first of her one-person shows was at Lauderdale House in Highgate, in 1993, the second at the Boundary Gallery in St John\u2019s Wood in 2001, both in north London, but it was the third that really established her reputation. In 2015, the Fine Art Society in Bond Street mounted the first West End exhibition of her work, to coincide with the publication of her autobiography, Lucky to Be an Artist. Fifty of her paintings from all periods were shown along with her etchings, accompanied by a group of pictures by her family: works by her parents, her uncles Gilbert Spencer and Richard Carline, and by her grandfather George Carline. This show came at the suggestion of a friend, the painter David Inshaw. He recalled visiting her house in Clapham (where, according to her son, she had inscribed \u201cDaring, Joy and Love\u201d on her bedroom wall), expecting to find it hung with paintings by herself and her parents. But the walls were oddly bare, with not even her own work in sight. The public has always been more interested in the Spencer/Carline family\u2019s eccentric lifestyle than in the art produced and Unity spent a substantial part of her life explaining if not defending her parents.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes.

In the late 1970s I was one of the first computer studies teachers. Our secondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational \u201cexperts\u201d who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnshire \u2022 John Harris addresses an important issue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint.

This happens all too often across the media. Local authorities do not \u201cpick up the tab\u201d when a person\u2019s assets fall to \u00a323,250. In fact, LAs continue to take \u00a31 per \u00a3250 on a sliding scale until a person\u2019s assets reach \u00a314,250. At this point a care home resident is allowed to hold on to the remaining sum. However, their contributions do not end there as a council will claw back any pensions, state or private, while also expecting families to pay top-up fees. My mother has severe dementia and has been in a nursing home for over four years and has paid over \u00a3250,000, having been compelled to sell her two-bedroom flat and use her savings. One of the major problems is the privatisation of care homes as there is no limit to what they can charge a self-funder when demand is so high. This inevitably means that a person\u2019s resources diminish quickly and then the LA has to step in.

And yet it\u2019s hard to avoid heaving a thankful sigh when Arisen My Senses, the opening track of her ninth studio album, Utopia, crashes into life: birdsong giving way to bright splashes of electronics, beatific-sounding harp chords and cascading beats not unlike the oft-sampled rhythm track of Schoolly D\u2019s old rap classic PSK, What Does It Mean? It sounds positively ecstatic, which comes as a relief. Utopia\u2019s predecessor, 2015\u2019s Vulnicura, was a remarkable record, a latterday entry into the canon of legendary break-up albums. It attained its place alongside Marvin Gaye\u2019s Here, My Dear and Dylan\u2019s Blood on the Tracks by setting its fathomless misery to atonal string arrangements and abstract electronics that, during its central track, kept vanishing into a single flatlining beep. It was raw, brave, challenging, unique and all the other adjectives heaped on it in reviews, but with the best will in the world, any album so harrowing that the appearance of gloom-laden vocalist Anohni constitutes a moment of light relief is going to be one that defies you to listen to it repeatedly. Utopia reanimates Vulnicura\u2019s collaboration with Venezuela-born electronic auteur Arca, but is made of lighter material. Aside from his endlessly shifting soundscapes, distorted beats and penchant for sonic tapestries made from manipulated vocal samples, the album\u2019s primary sound is woodwind, provided by an assembly of 12 female flautists from Reykjavik, which automatically lends it a far airier quality than the claustrophobic Vulnicura. It is, Bj\u00f6rk says, her \u201cTinder album\u201d, and its advance billing as a kind of Songs for Swinging Bachelorettes is borne out by its lyrics, which are obsessed both with technology and the vicissitudes of budding romance. \u201cIs this excess texting blessing?\u201d ponders Blissing Me, the saga of \u201ctwo music nerds \u2026 sending each other MP3s\u201d, before reverting to grief: \u201cour physical union a fantasy, I just fell in love with a song\u201d.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

And nowhere is this more the case than with this Japanese noodle dish. There is something quite solitary about a bowl of ramen. Maybe it\u2019s the inevitable slurping that comes with noodles and soup, which is why I often find myself eating it on my own, a calm meditative pleasure in the middle of a hectic day or when I\u2019m in need of some bolstering warmth. Most people will know ramen as noodles served in a deeply flavoured meat broth, and while meat is not my thing, I get the appeal of that savoury, umami bowlful.

The Simon Langton grammar school for boys in Canterbury, which caused controversy last year when it invited its former pupil Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing controversialist, to speak, sparked fresh concerns this week with a new debating forum that it said was designed to be \u201can antidote to the poison of political correctness\u201d. Some parents and pupils backed the school. But now it has distanced itself from the term \u201cunsafe space\u201d after other pupils and parents voiced their alarm on social media. The local Labour MP whose sons attended the school but have now left also voiced her reservations. The scheme\u2019s name is a reference to the phrase \u201csafe space\u201d \u2013 a zone in which a person or category of people can feel confident they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment or any other emotional or physical harm. The head of school, Ken Moffat, said the phrase unsafe space was \u201ca bit of a misnomer\u201d. \u201cThe name is the Tong Centre for Creative Research, it is not called \u2018the unsafe space\u2019 and that\u2019s not a phrase I am wedded to and expect to see wither over time.\u201d In a letter to parents, Moffat dismissed concerns raised in media reports. \u201cOur aim is quite simple: to continue with what we are already doing in allowing our young men and women to debate interesting ideas at the highest level possible with speakers from both within and without the school community,\u201d he wrote. \u201cJust because we use the term \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 does not mean we will indulge homophobic, xenophobic, racist or sexist beliefs.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

And given the news that growth had been downgraded to 1.5% and the low forecasts for growth stretching out until 2022, Philip Hammond needed all the laughs he could get. Things didn\u2019t go brilliantly in the run-up to the speech. First up, people noticed how the Treasury team didn\u2019t quite manage to pull off a tribute to the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album cover. Then the chancellor got stuck in traffic on the way from Downing Street to the House of Commons. Behind a white van with a Europhile logo. This came days after he avoided another potentially awkward vehicle-related photo op as a passenger in a self-driving car. There may have been a U-turn on taking that car trip, but Hammond didn\u2019t back away from mentioning self-driving vehicles in his speech. \u201cI know that Jeremy Clarkson doesn\u2019t like them, but there are also other reasons to pursue this technology,\u201d he said, going on to indulge in some wordplay about Clarkson\u2019s fellow Grand Tour presenters, suggesting it was \u201cnot the first time you\u2019ve been snubbed by Hammond and May\u201d. The line went down well in some quarters.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.  Your answer must contain exactly 5 bullet points.

Hans Bunting, the chief operating officer of renewables at Innogy SE, part of the company that owns the UK energy supplier npower, said offshore windfarms had become mainstream and were destined to become even cheaper because of new, bigger turbines. Asked whether nuclear groups that want to build new reactors in the UK could compete with windfarms on cost, even when their intermittency was taken into account, Bunting replied: \u201cObviously they can\u2019t.\u201d His comments came after MPs criticised the \u00a330bn cost to consumers for EDF Energy\u2019s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and said ministers should revisit the case for new nuclear before proceeding with more projects. Innogy recently secured a subsidy of \u00a374.75 per megawatt hour of power to build a windfarm off the Lincolnshire coast, which is \u00a317.75 cheaper than Hinkley and should be completed about three years earlier. \u201cWhat we see now [with prices] is with today\u2019s technology. It\u2019s not about tomorrow\u2019s technology, which is about [to come in] 2025, 2027, when Hinkley will most likely come to the grid ... and then it [windfarms] will be even cheaper.\u201d While the company is planning to use the most powerful turbines in the world today for the Lincolnshire windfarm, Bunting said even bigger ones in development would drive costs down further. \u201cA few years ago everyone thought 10MW [turbines] was the maximum, now we\u2019re talking about 15[MW]. It seems the sky is the limit,\u201d he said. \u201c[It] means less turbines for the same capacity, less steel in the ground, less cables, even bigger rotors catching more wind, so it will become cheaper.\u201d However, EDF argued that nuclear was also on a path to lower costs. \u201cEarly offshore wind projects started at around \u00a3150 per MW/h and developers have shown they can offer lower prices by repeating projects with an established supply chain \u2013 the same is true for nuclear,\u201d an EDF spokesman said.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.
