The article describes the film as a 'dogged and decent' wartime saga set in 1918 Italy, where the war feels more like a defeat than a victory. The story centers on two childhood friends, Giulio and Stefano, who work as doctors in a military hospital that has become a battleground. Stefano is portrayed as a by-the-book doctor, focused on freeing beds quickly, while Giulio secretly acts as 'the Holy Hand,' deliberately infecting and maiming patients to send them home. Both men are metaphorically playing God on the ward, and their moral dilemmas eventually lead to a clash of ideologies. Amelio, a veteran of Italian cinema, directs the film with a 'robust, old-school efficiency,' emphasizing the film's tense and gritty atmosphere. Despite its strengths, the film is noted as being 'better than most' but ultimately 'doomed to be gunned down by the judges,' reflecting its struggle to make an impact in the festival's main competition. The article underscores the film's domestic production and its attempt to leverage its home-turf advantage, but it concludes that this does not significantly enhance its chances of standing out in the festival's intense competition.\""}

The team has been taking more risks, leading to a high number of shots in the Premier League during the early part of the season. Despite this, their conversion rate has been low, as evidenced by their inability to score from 16 attempts in a recent match. The game saw an equalizer from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, who scored against his former team, Wolves, who managed to secure their first point of the season. The match was marked by a flurry of activity, with both teams scoring within the first 12 minutes, highlighting the intensity and unpredictability of the game.\n\nSection 2\nNottingham Forest's attacking prowess has been a topic of discussion, especially given the influx of new players during the summer transfer window. The team has had 53 shots in their first three games, indicating a strong offensive presence. However, the lack of goals suggests that there is room for improvement in converting these opportunities into victories. Among the new signings, Morgan Gibbs-White stands out as a key player, contributing significantly to the team's creativity and playmaking. His performance in the match against Wolves, where he was instrumental in setting up the equalizer, has earned him praise from his manager, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, who expressed his delight and support for the young player's development.\n\nSection 3\nThe match between Nottingham Forest and Wolves was a testament to the dynamic nature of football, with both teams showcasing their strengths and weaknesses.

Nor was it his rightwing takeover of higher education, the banning of books from school libraries, his restriction of drag shows, or passive assent of neo-Nazis parading outside Disney World waving flags bearing the extremist governor\u2019s name that caused them to finally stand up to him. It was, instead, a love of vulnerable Florida scrub jays; a passion to preserve threatened gopher tortoises; and above all a unanimous desire to speak up for nature in defiance of Ron DeSantis\u2019s mind-boggling plan to pave over thousands of unspoiled acres at nine state parks and erect 350-room hotels, golf courses and pickleball courts. The outcry when DeSantis\u2019s department of environmental protection (DEP) unveiled its absurdly named Great Outdoors Initiative last week was immediate, overwhelming and unprecedented. The Republican Florida senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott penned a joint letter slamming an \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d proposal to build a golf course at Jonathan Dickinson state park in Martin county. The Republican congressman Brian Mast, usually a reliable DeSantis ally, said it would happen \u201cover my dead body\u201d. Scores of Republican state congress members and senators, whose achievements during the more than five years since DeSantis was elected governor have been largely limited to rubber-stamping his hard-right agenda, lined up to denounce the projects. Many noted the plans had been drawn up in secret, with no-bid contracts destined for mysteriously pre-chosen developers outside the requirements of Florida law. Thousands of environmental advocates and activists swamped multiple state parks on Tuesday in a day of action to protest against not only the ravaging of broad swathes of wildlife habitat, but DeSantis\u2019s lack of transparency and intention to limit public comment to only one hour at each state park during meetings that would be held simultaneously. By Wednesday, DeSantis\u2019s initiative was in effect dead, as the governor, clearly chastened by the unexpected all-quarters challenge to his previously unquestioned authority, furiously back-pedaled at an awkward press conference in Winter Haven.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

(Radio 4) | BBC Sounds I had mixed feelings about Radio 2\u2019s bank holiday Monday offering: a five-hour celebration of the late Steve Wright, made up of a station tribute hosted by Vernon Kay, a fan tribute with Liza Tarbuck, and Steve Wright in His Own Words, which delved into the BBC archives. Wright was a hugely loved Radio 2 staple, and the shows were the correct combination of warm-hearted and slightly cheesy (though, lest we forget, he\u2019d been moved on from his afternoon show just over a year before he died in February). The Kay programme featured some interesting comments from celebrity fans: Stewart Lee made a clever point about how Wright\u2019s 1980s on-air characters, such as Mr Angry, foreshadowed catchphrase-driven sketch shows such as The Fast Show and Little Britain (Lee: \u201cA character comes on and says that thing, and how long can you delay the gratification of them saying that thing?\u201d). I also loved the unexpected variety of music and pop star appearances that the archive show gave us: the Beatles chatting casually; the Bee Gees giving a spine-tingling impromptu acoustic performance. \u201cHe was always there for us,\u201d said Barry Gibb. \u201cWe\u2019ve done other interviews, but the only ones we really remember are the ones with Steve Wright.\u201d The fan show was full of love, which is fine. And I enjoyed hearing Wright discussing his personal audio influences, sharp as a tack on presenters and what they were good at. Tony Blackburn, he said, was a comedian, in the manner of a northern club comic: he\u2019d play a track, set up a joke, deliver the punchline and move to the next. Aside from all of that, I found much of the tribute madly uncomfortable, mostly because of the era it evoked \u2013 the 1970s and 80s, when Radio 1 was huge.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The special was hosted by Vernon Kay, who led a station tribute that included insights from celebrity fans and a deep dive into Wright's on-air persona. Liza Tarbuck hosted a fan tribute, which was filled with personal stories and memories, while the BBC archives provided a nostalgic look at Wright's career, featuring rare and memorable moments.\n\nWright, a staple of Radio 2, was known for his warm-hearted and slightly cheesy style, which endeared him to millions of listeners. The special was a fitting tribute to his legacy, as it highlighted his unique ability to connect with his audience and his enduring impact on British radio. The program featured a mix of music, pop star appearances, and candid interviews, all of which showcased Wright's versatility and charm. The Beatles, for example, were seen chatting casually on air, while the Bee Gees delivered a spine-tingling impromptu acoustic performance.

Tony Blackburn, a fellow broadcaster, was described by Wright as a comedian in the manner of a northern club comic, highlighting the unique style that each presenter brought to the airwaves.\n\nDespite the warmth and affection that permeated the special, there were moments that felt uncomfortable, particularly when reflecting on the era in which Wright worked. The 1970s and 80s were a time when Radio 1 was at the height of its popularity, and the special evoked a sense of nostalgia for that bygone era. The program was a reminder of how much Wright had meant to his generation and how his legacy continues to resonate with listeners today.\n\nIn conclusion, the Radio 2 Remembers Steve Wright special was a fitting tribute to a beloved broadcaster.

Churchill\u2019s British Restaurants, a chain of government-funded canteens offering nutritious price-capped meals, were intended to counter inflation in food and fuel prices related to the war, as well as to boost community spirit. At their peak, there were more British Restaurants across the UK than there are branches of McDonald\u2019s or Wetherspoons today. Now a new report is calling for the return of a \u201cnational restaurant service\u201d in some form, as a way to tackle contemporary issues such as health inequality, food insecurity and even climate change in the UK. A forthcoming report entitled Public diners: the idea whose time has come, by food policy NGO Nourish Scotland, marks the beginning of a campaign to introduce restaurants as a new piece of national infrastructure, a call backed by politicians and experts. A public diner, according to the report, is a state-subsidised eatery serving quality and ethically produced food at affordable prices. Crucially, says Nourish Scotland, they are neither charity nor a treat, but rather everyday eating places for entire communities to access.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

To address these issues, the British government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, established a chain of government-funded canteens known as British Restaurants. These establishments aimed to provide high-quality, nutritious meals at reasonable prices, catering to people from all walks of life. The rapid expansion of the chain, with up to 10 new sites opening weekly, demonstrated its popularity and effectiveness in addressing both economic and social concerns. At its peak, the number of British Restaurants surpassed the combined total of McDonald's and Wetherspoons outlets in the UK today.\n\nFast forward to the present day, a new report by the food policy NGO Nourish Scotland, titled \"Public diners: the idea whose time has come,\" is advocating for the reintroduction of a similar concept. The report suggests that a national restaurant service could play a crucial role in tackling modern-day issues such as health inequality, food insecurity, and climate change. This initiative would involve state-subsidized eateries offering ethically produced, high-quality meals at affordable prices, ensuring that they are accessible to everyone in the community. The goal is to create a network of public diners that serve as everyday eating places, rather than charity or luxury options.\n\nThe proposal has garnered support from various politicians and experts who recognize the potential benefits of such a system. By providing a reliable source of nutritious food, public diners could help reduce the prevalence of diet-related health problems and improve overall well-being. Additionally, the emphasis on ethical production methods aligns with broader environmental goals, contributing to sustainable practices and reducing the carbon footprint associated with food consumption. The idea of a national restaurant service represents a holistic approach to addressing multiple societal challenges through a single, integrated solution.\n\nSea change is needed in how we think about food and its role in our lives. The concept of public diners offers a fresh perspective on the importance of accessible, high-quality meals for all members of society. By integrating this idea into our national infrastructure, we can foster a more equitable and sustainable food system. The success of the original British Restaurants during wartime demonstrates the potential impact of such initiatives. As we face new challenges in the 21st century, the return of a national restaurant service could be a vital step towards building a healthier, more resilient future for the UK."}

Upton\u2019s advocacy for mental health and her resilience in the face of adversity serve as a powerful example of how individuals can overcome trauma and use their experiences to make a positive impact.  \n\n***  \n\nJD Vance\u2019s decision to share a video of Caitlin Upton\u2019s moment during the Miss Teen USA competition to criticize Kamala Harris has drawn criticism for its insensitivity. Upton, who has spoken openly about her struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, has condemned the incident and expressed regret over the backlash she faced. Vance\u2019s refusal to apologize to Upton, despite her advocacy for mental health, has further fueled the debate about accountability and empathy in public discourse. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of treating individuals with kindness and understanding, especially in the face of public scrutiny.  \n\n***  \n\nP.P.S: The story of Caitlin Upton highlights the profound impact of public humiliation and the importance of empathy in addressing such situations. Her journey from a moment of embarrassment to becoming a mental health advocate is a testament to resilience and the power of support. The incident also underscores the need for accountability in public figures, as JD Vance\u2019s actions have sparked further discussion about the treatment of individuals who have faced similar challenges. Ultimately, Upton\u2019s story serves as a reminder of the importance of compassion and understanding in a world where mistakes can have lasting consequences."}

Co-directed by Ludovic and Zoran Boukherma from Nicolas Mathieu\u2019s bestselling novel, this is a state-of-the-nation drama dressed up as a coming-of-age tale (or possibly vice-versa); it is at once intimate and expansive in the way in which it connects the low-rise estates to the posh homes on the hill. It also brings a dose of dirty social-realism to this year\u2019s Venice film festival. The time-frame is the 90s, although its socio-economic tensions still apply, just as the (fictional) burg of Heillange is broadly representative of a thousand other towns in France and elsewhere; living in the shadow of its shuttered steelworks and inhabited by too many people with too little to do. Heillange, we are told, is \u201ca town of hard times\u201d, where the big local news is the opening of an indoor ski slope. The white ex-steelworkers live in humdrum terraced houses and the immigrant ex-steelworkers live in the humdrum block of flats down the road. Neither camp evidently has much to do with the other until a minor crisis triggers a chain reaction. Our tour guide of sorts is gauche Anthony (wonderfully embodied by Paul Kircher), who is 14 years old at the start of the tale. One night he takes his dad\u2019s motorbike and rides out of town to a party, forlornly hoping to impress beautiful, middle-class Steph (Angelina Voreth). In the garden Anthony is involved in a brief altercation with Hacine (Sayyid El Amani), an \u201cArab kid\u201d who promptly absconds with the bike as payback.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The town, with its shuttered factories and a population struggling to find purpose, serves as the backdrop for a poignant narrative that delves into the lives of its disaffected youth. The story, co-directed by Ludovic and Zoran Boukherma, is adapted from Nicolas Mathieu\u2019s bestselling novel and is set in the 1990s, though its themes of socio-economic disparity and racial tension remain relevant today. The film, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival, is a powerful exploration of class and racial divides, wrapped in the guise of a coming-of-age tale.\n\nThe narrative is introduced through the eyes of Anthony, a 14-year-old boy who embodies the struggles of the town\u2019s youth. Anthony, played by Paul Kircher, is a character of awkward charm, navigating the complexities of adolescence in a town where opportunities are scarce. One night, Anthony takes his father\u2019s motorbike and rides out of town to a party, hoping to impress Steph, a beautiful middle-class girl. His journey takes a dramatic turn when he encounters Hacine, an immigrant youth, in the garden. The brief altercation leads to Hacine absconding with the bike, setting off a chain of events that will have far-reaching consequences for the town.\n\nThe film\u2019s setting is crucial to its narrative, as Heillange is depicted as a microcosm of broader societal issues. The town is divided into two distinct communities: the white ex-steelworkers who live in humdrum terraced houses and the immigrant ex-steelworkers who reside in a block of flats down the road. These communities, though geographically close, are worlds apart, separated by economic hardship and cultural differences. The opening of an indoor ski slope, a minor event in the town\u2019s news, highlights the stark contrast between the aspirations of the youth and the reality of their lives. The film\u2019s social realism is further emphasized by its portrayal of the town\u2019s struggles, from the shuttered steelworks to the shuttered dreams of its residents.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the film explores the interconnectedness of the town\u2019s residents, showing how the actions of one individual can have a ripple effect on the entire community. The tension between the two communities comes to a head, leading to a crisis that forces them to confront their differences. The film\u2019s intimate and expansive narrative style allows it to delve into the personal lives of its characters while also addressing broader societal issues. Through its portrayal of Anthony\u2019s journey, the film offers a poignant commentary on the challenges faced by disaffected youth in a town on the brink of change.\n\nGolf, the town\u2019s indoor ski slope, becomes a symbol of hope and aspiration for the youth, offering a glimpse of a better future. However, the reality of their lives is far from the glamorous world of skiing. The film\u2019s exploration of class and racial tensions is both timely and timeless, offering a powerful reflection on the socio-economic challenges faced by communities around the world. Through its compelling narrative and richly drawn characters, the film invites viewers to consider the complexities of life in a small town and the struggles of its youth."}

The match began with Arsenal in control, thanks to Kai Havertz's stunning goal, but the momentum shifted dramatically when Declan Rice was sent off for a bizarre incident involving a free-kick. Rice's red card, his first in the Premier League, not only cost Arsenal a key player but also disrupted their rhythm. Brighton capitalized on the setback, with J\u00f5ao Pedro equalizing, and the game ended in a draw.

But when it comes to marital traditions, trends appear to be moving in a different direction. Traditionally in the Swedish church, which is Lutheran, the bride and groom walk down the aisle together rather than the bride being accompanied by her father, as is often the case in Britain and the US. But in recent years \u2013 perhaps inspired by the influence of global television, films and social media \u2013 more Swedish women are requesting to be \u201chanded over\u201d by their fathers. The issue of what some Swedes describe as \u201cthe Hollywood tradition\u201d has been simmering for some time \u2013 particularly in 2010, when Sweden\u2019s crown princess, Victoria, decided to be partly walked down the aisle by her father, King Carl Gustaf. In recent days, the debate has reignited after a motion was submitted to the autumn meeting of the Swedish church to ban the practice of fathers handing over their daughters at the altar. Sara Waldenfors, a pastor in Nyl\u00f6se, Gothenburg, who along with Jesper Eneroth put forward the proposal for a ban, said there was no escaping the patriarchal symbolism. \u201cThe relatively new trend that the father walks the bride down the aisle and passes her over to her new husband is not in our church tradition,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cEven though the scene feels nice for future bridal couples, we can\u2019t disregard what it symbolises: a father handing over a minor virgin to her new guardian.\u201d According to Swedish tradition, the bride and groom walk down the aisle together.

Traditionally, in the Swedish Lutheran church, the bride and groom walk down the aisle together, a custom that contrasts with the more common practice in Britain and the US, where the bride is accompanied by her father. In recent years, influenced by global media and cultural trends, more Swedish women are requesting to be \u201chanded over\u201d by their fathers at the altar, a tradition often associated with Hollywood.
