Brands pay a commission on customers directed to them via the website, with Easyfundraising passing at least half to the good cause chosen by the buyer. But its activities are now being examined the Charity Commission after a complaint from Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who founded the airline easyJet and has an \u201carmy of lawyers\u201d to defend what he considers are infringements of the use of the easy brand. The billionaire\u2019s easyGroup launched legal action against Easyfundraising over the use of the word \u201ceasy\u201d, with a trial concluding last June and judgment expected in the next few months. But his criticism of the company didn\u2019t end there. His legal team cited concerns in court from user reviews that the operation, which is backed by the UK private equity firm Palatine, is using \u201ca charity guise\u201d for an affiliate money-making scheme. Haji-Ioannou originally sent a complaint to the commission in March and has also now cited further evidence provided from the court case. He said it had emerged that only 13% of the good causes on the website are registered charities, and it was an \u201cegregious misrepresentation\u201d for the firm to be described on Facebook as a \u201ccharity organisation\u201d. Haji-Ioannou said: \u201cI believe they can only make money by misleading the donating public that they are a charity \u2013 when in fact they are a very profitable company [backed] by private equity.\u201d Easyfundraising hit back this weekend, saying it is being targeted by what it considered were \u201cmud-slinging tactics\u201d; that users were clearly informed it was a private firm; and that it complies with all relevant charity and fundraising regulations.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

Nor was it his rightwing takeover of higher education, the banning of books from school libraries, his restriction of drag shows, or passive assent of neo-Nazis parading outside Disney World waving flags bearing the extremist governor\u2019s name that caused them to finally stand up to him.

Thousands of environmental advocates and activists swamped multiple state parks on Tuesday in a day of action to protest against not only the ravaging of broad swathes of wildlife habitat, but DeSantis\u2019s lack of transparency and intention to limit public comment to only one hour at each state park during meetings that would be held simultaneously. By Wednesday, DeSantis\u2019s initiative was in effect dead, as the governor, clearly chastened by the unexpected all-quarters challenge to his previously unquestioned authority, furiously back-pedaled at an awkward press conference in Winter Haven.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The brains behind the operation? The British government, led by the prime minister, Winston Churchill.

These restaurants served high-quality meals at reasonable prices and attracted customers from all walks of life. At their peak, there were more British Restaurants across the UK than there are branches of McDonald's or Wetherspoons today. Now, a new report is calling for the return of a \"national restaurant service\" in some form, as a way to tackle contemporary issues such as health inequality, food insecurity, and even climate change in the UK.\n\nThe report, entitled Public diners: the idea whose time has come, by food policy NGO Nourish Scotland, marks the beginning of a campaign to introduce restaurants as a new piece of national infrastructure. A public diner, according to the report, is a state-subsidized eatery serving quality and ethically produced food at affordable prices. Crucially, says Nourish Scotland, they are neither charity nor a treat, but rather everyday eating places for entire communities to access.\n\nThe report argues that public diners could play a crucial role in addressing health inequality, as they would provide access to nutritious food for people who may not be able to afford it otherwise. They could also help to reduce food waste, as surplus food could be donated to public diners. Furthermore, the report suggests that public diners could help to reduce the carbon footprint of the food industry, as they would encourage the consumption of locally sourced and seasonal produce.\n\nIn conclusion, the report calls for the introduction of public diners as a new piece of national infrastructure. The report argues that public diners could play a crucial role in addressing contemporary issues such as health inequality, food insecurity, and climate change. The report is backed by politicians and experts, and it marks the beginning of a campaign to introduce public diners across the UK."}

Enzo Maresca, Chelsea\u2019s new head coach, had asked for two positions to be strengthened before the end of the transfer window. He wanted a centre-back and a top No 9. After months of flirting with the idea, Chelsea were willing to throw everything they had at landing the Napoli striker Victor Osimhen. Late on Friday night, though, the recruitment team had to admit defeat in their attempt to convince Osimhen to fit into Chelsea\u2019s wage structure. There was no new centre-back either, although there was still a flurry of activity. Jadon Sancho was signed from Manchester United on loan with an obligation to buy and will compete with Pedro Neto, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Christopher Nkunku and Mykhailo Mudryk for a place in attacking midfield. Raheem Sterling, who was told there was not enough room for him on the flanks, was hastily loaned to Arsenal.
