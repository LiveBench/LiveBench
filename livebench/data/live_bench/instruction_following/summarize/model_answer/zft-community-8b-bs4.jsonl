Gianni Amelio\u2019s tense wartime saga is better than most but that counts for little when the battle heats up. It is 1918, \u201cthe Year of Victory\u201d, although in smalltown Italy it feels more akin to defeat. Alessandro Borghi and Gabriel Montesi play Giulio and Stefano, two childhood friends who work as doctors in a military hospital that has become a battleground of its own, toiling to patch up the casualties and truck them back to the front. Stefano is straight-backed, by the book, intent on freeing the beds as quickly as possible. Giulio, meanwhile, moonlights every night as \u201cthe Holy Hand\u201d, deliberately infecting and maiming his patients so that they might be sent home.

Co-directed by Ludovic and Zoran Boukherma from Nicolas Mathieu's bestselling novel, this is a state-of-the-nation drama dressed up as a coming-of-age tale (or possibly vice-versa); it is at once intimate and expansive in the way in which it connects the low-rise estates to the posh homes on the hill. It also brings a dose of dirty social-realism to this year's Venice film festival. The time-frame is the 90s, although its socio-economic tensions still apply, just as the (fictional) burg of Heillange is broadly representative of a thousand other towns in France and elsewhere; living in the shadow of its shuttered steelworks and inhabited by too many people with too little to do. Heillange, we are told, is \"a town of hard times\", where the big local news is the opening of an indoor ski slope. The white ex-steelworkers live in humdrum terraced houses and the immigrant ex-steelworkers live in the humdrum block of flats down the road. Neither camp evidently has much to do with the other until a minor crisis triggers a chain reaction. Our tour guide of sorts is gauche Anthony (wonderfully embodied by Paul Kircher), who is 14 years old at the start of the tale. One night he takes his dad's motorbike and rides out of town to a party, forlornly hoping to impress beautiful, middle-class Steph (Angelina Voreth). In the garden Anthony is involved in a brief altercation with Hacine (Sayyid El Amani), an \"Arab kid\" who promptly absconds with the bike as payback. \\n\\nThe film is a powerful exploration of the socio-economic tensions that exist in small-town France, and the way in which these tensions can lead to violence and unrest. The film is also a coming-of-age tale, as Anthony struggles to find his place in the world and to come to terms with the violence and unrest that surrounds him. The film is a state-of-the-nation drama, as it explores the issues that are facing France today, and the way in which these issues are affecting the lives of ordinary people. The film is also a social-realist drama, as it portrays the lives of ordinary people in a realistic and unflinching way. \\n\\nGolf is a sport that is played on a course consisting of a series of holes. Each hole has a tee box, a fairway, and a green. The object of the game is to hit the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. The player with the lowest score wins. The game of golf is played with a variety of clubs, each of which is designed for a specific purpose. The most common clubs are the driver, the iron, and the putter. The driver is used to hit the ball a long distance, the iron is used to hit the ball a shorter distance, and the putter is used to hit the ball into the hole.

The study, led by Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, an internist at the University of California San Francisco, highlights the importance of knowing about alternatives to tubal ligation, as every form of contraception fails at some point. The study is especially relevant in the context of the US Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, which has led to increased interest in permanent female surgical sterilization among women aged 18-30. The study analyzed data from four iterations of the US National Survey of Family Growth from 2002 to 2015, covering 31,000 women, of which 4,184 reported tubal ligation. Between 3 and 5% of these women reported pregnancy after surgery. The study underscores the need to make peace with the fact that there will always be some need for abortion services, as even highly effective methods of contraception can fail not infrequently.\" P.P.S."]}], "tstamp": 1755050212.7638593, "total_output_tokens": 246, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}
