The article describes the film as a 'dogged and decent' wartime saga set in 1918 Italy, where the war feels more like a defeat than a victory. The story centers on two childhood friends, Giulio and Stefano, who work as doctors in a military hospital that has become a battleground. Stefano is portrayed as a by-the-book doctor, focused on freeing beds quickly, while Giulio secretly acts as 'the Holy Hand,' deliberately infecting and maiming patients to send them home. Both men are metaphorically playing God on the ward, and their moral dilemmas eventually lead to a clash of ideologies. Amelio, a veteran of Italian cinema, directs the film with a 'robust, old-school efficiency,' emphasizing the film's tense and gritty atmosphere. Despite its strengths, the film is noted as being 'better than most' but ultimately 'doomed to be gunned down by the judges,' reflecting its struggle to make an impact in the festival's main competition. The article underscores the film's domestic production and its attempt to leverage its home-turf advantage, but it concludes that this does not significantly enhance its chances of standing out in the festival's intense competition.\""]}], "tstamp": 1755256103.4886224, "total_output_tokens": 276, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

The program, which spanned five hours, was a blend of station-hosted tributes, fan contributions, and archival material, all aimed at celebrating the life and career of Steve Wright. The special was hosted by Vernon Kay, who led a station tribute that included insights from celebrity fans and a deep dive into Wright's on-air persona. Liza Tarbuck hosted a fan tribute, which was filled with personal stories and memories, while the BBC archives provided a nostalgic look at Wright's career, featuring rare and memorable moments.\n\nWright, a staple of Radio 2, was known for his warm-hearted and slightly cheesy style, which endeared him to millions of listeners. The special was a fitting tribute to his legacy, as it highlighted his unique ability to connect with his audience and his enduring impact on British radio. The program featured a mix of music, pop star appearances, and candid interviews, all of which showcased Wright's versatility and charm. The Beatles, for example, were seen chatting casually on air, while the Bee Gees delivered a spine-tingling impromptu acoustic performance. Barry Gibb, one of the Bee Gees, shared a poignant memory of Wright, saying, \"He was always there for us. We\u2019ve done other interviews, but the only ones we really remember are the ones with Steve Wright.\"\n\nThe fan tribute was a touching reminder of the deep affection that Wright had for his listeners. It was filled with love and nostalgia, as fans shared their favorite moments and memories of Wright. The special also included a segment where Wright discussed his personal audio influences, his thoughts on presenters, and his career. Tony Blackburn, a fellow broadcaster, was described by Wright as a comedian in the manner of a northern club comic, highlighting the unique style that each presenter brought to the airwaves.\n\nDespite the warmth and affection that permeated the special, there were moments that felt uncomfortable, particularly when reflecting on the era in which Wright worked. The 1970s and 80s were a time when Radio 1 was at the height of its popularity, and the special evoked a sense of nostalgia for that bygone era. The program was a reminder of how much Wright had meant to his generation and how his legacy continues to resonate with listeners today.\n\nIn conclusion, the Radio 2 Remembers Steve Wright special was a fitting tribute to a beloved broadcaster. It was a celebration of Wright's life and career, filled with warmth, nostalgia, and a deep sense of appreciation for his contributions to British radio. The special was a reminder of the power of radio to connect people and create lasting memories, and it was a testament to the enduring legacy of Steve Wright.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"]}], "tstamp": 1755256149.6954434, "total_output_tokens": 603, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

The spokesperson for the Met Office has also cautioned that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from flood water, lightning strikes, hail, or strong winds.

The spokesperson has said that a few showers and isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop across parts of southern England on Saturday night, but by Sunday morning, there is an increasing risk of more active and organised heavy showers and thunderstorms moving in to, or developing across, parts of southern England. The risk of storms will then steadily transfer broadly northwards through the afternoon and into the early evening. The extent of these thunderstorms is very uncertain, and many places will miss them, but where they do occur, 30-40mm of rain may fall in less than an hour with perhaps over 75mm in one or two places, leading to a chance of flooding and disruption.

The town, with its shuttered factories and a population struggling to find purpose, serves as the backdrop for a poignant narrative that delves into the lives of its disaffected youth. The story, co-directed by Ludovic and Zoran Boukherma, is adapted from Nicolas Mathieu\u2019s bestselling novel and is set in the 1990s, though its themes of socio-economic disparity and racial tension remain relevant today. The film, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival, is a powerful exploration of class and racial divides, wrapped in the guise of a coming-of-age tale.\n\nThe narrative is introduced through the eyes of Anthony, a 14-year-old boy who embodies the struggles of the town\u2019s youth. Anthony, played by Paul Kircher, is a character of awkward charm, navigating the complexities of adolescence in a town where opportunities are scarce. One night, Anthony takes his father\u2019s motorbike and rides out of town to a party, hoping to impress Steph, a beautiful middle-class girl. His journey takes a dramatic turn when he encounters Hacine, an immigrant youth, in the garden. The brief altercation leads to Hacine absconding with the bike, setting off a chain of events that will have far-reaching consequences for the town.\n\nThe film\u2019s setting is crucial to its narrative, as Heillange is depicted as a microcosm of broader societal issues. The town is divided into two distinct communities: the white ex-steelworkers who live in humdrum terraced houses and the immigrant ex-steelworkers who reside in a block of flats down the road. These communities, though geographically close, are worlds apart, separated by economic hardship and cultural differences. The opening of an indoor ski slope, a minor event in the town\u2019s news, highlights the stark contrast between the aspirations of the youth and the reality of their lives. The film\u2019s social realism is further emphasized by its portrayal of the town\u2019s struggles, from the shuttered steelworks to the shuttered dreams of its residents.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the film explores the interconnectedness of the town\u2019s residents, showing how the actions of one individual can have a ripple effect on the entire community. The tension between the two communities comes to a head, leading to a crisis that forces them to confront their differences. The film\u2019s intimate and expansive narrative style allows it to delve into the personal lives of its characters while also addressing broader societal issues. Through its portrayal of Anthony\u2019s journey, the film offers a poignant commentary on the challenges faced by disaffected youth in a town on the brink of change.\n\nGolf, the town\u2019s indoor ski slope, becomes a symbol of hope and aspiration for the youth, offering a glimpse of a better future. However, the reality of their lives is far from the glamorous world of skiing. The film\u2019s exploration of class and racial tensions is both timely and timeless, offering a powerful reflection on the socio-economic challenges faced by communities around the world. Through its compelling narrative and richly drawn characters, the film invites viewers to consider the complexities of life in a small town and the struggles of its youth."]}], "tstamp": 1755256178.6364675, "total_output_tokens": 680, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

A lone fighter, you streak across an alien planet attacking swirling flocks of UFOs and purplish space jellyfish as they pipette across the screen. Stylistically reminiscent of the polarity-swapping arcade classic Ikaruga, Cygni is a technological masterclass, your spaceship sweeping over distant robot battlefields, buffeted in the blast of a thousand fireworks.

To address these issues, the British government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, established a chain of government-funded canteens known as British Restaurants. These establishments aimed to provide high-quality, nutritious meals at reasonable prices, catering to people from all walks of life. The rapid expansion of the chain, with up to 10 new sites opening weekly, demonstrated its popularity and effectiveness in addressing both economic and social concerns. At its peak, the number of British Restaurants surpassed the combined total of McDonald's and Wetherspoons outlets in the UK today.\n\nFast forward to the present day, a new report by the food policy NGO Nourish Scotland, titled \"Public diners: the idea whose time has come,\" is advocating for the reintroduction of a similar concept. The report suggests that a national restaurant service could play a crucial role in tackling modern-day issues such as health inequality, food insecurity, and climate change. This initiative would involve state-subsidized eateries offering ethically produced, high-quality meals at affordable prices, ensuring that they are accessible to everyone in the community. The goal is to create a network of public diners that serve as everyday eating places, rather than charity or luxury options.\n\nThe proposal has garnered support from various politicians and experts who recognize the potential benefits of such a system. By providing a reliable source of nutritious food, public diners could help reduce the prevalence of diet-related health problems and improve overall well-being. Additionally, the emphasis on ethical production methods aligns with broader environmental goals, contributing to sustainable practices and reducing the carbon footprint associated with food consumption. The idea of a national restaurant service represents a holistic approach to addressing multiple societal challenges through a single, integrated solution.\n\nSea change is needed in how we think about food and its role in our lives. The concept of public diners offers a fresh perspective on the importance of accessible, high-quality meals for all members of society. By integrating this idea into our national infrastructure, we can foster a more equitable and sustainable food system. The success of the original British Restaurants during wartime demonstrates the potential impact of such initiatives. As we face new challenges in the 21st century, the return of a national restaurant service could be a vital step towards building a healthier, more resilient future for the UK."]}], "tstamp": 1755256268.2846193, "total_output_tokens": 501, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

Rice's red card, his first in the Premier League, not only cost Arsenal a key player but also disrupted their rhythm.
