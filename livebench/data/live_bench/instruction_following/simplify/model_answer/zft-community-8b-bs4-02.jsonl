The carmaker argued that lower targets would not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers, and investors to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. However, Ford's stance has since shifted dramatically, reflecting the industry's struggle with slowing demand for electric cars.

In a rare and poignant glimpse into the tragedy, he says the time he and his wife, Sarah, spent at their baby Jennifer\u2019s bedside \u201cas her life ebbed away\u201d were \u201camong the most precious days of [our] lives\u201d. In an article for the Guardian, Brown says the debate on assisted dying is moving too fast given the \u201cprofound ethical and practical issues\u201d, and the state of the NHS means this is not the right time for a far-reaching decision. Instead of a yes/no vote in parliament, Brown writes that a commission to devise a \u201cfully funded, 10-year strategy for improved and comprehensive palliative care\u201d should be set up. He cites unpublished polling showing that half the public are not confident of the government\u2019s ability to fund specialist end-of-life care, and that more than two-thirds back a commission on the issue. MPs are due to vote next week on a private member\u2019s bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. MPs have been given a free vote, meaning individuals rather than parties will decide whether to back or reject the bill. Supporters and opponents of the bill are expected to increase their lobbying of undecided MPs over the next few days as uncertainty surrounds the outcome of the historic vote. Brown says he and Sarah knew the extent of Jennifer\u2019s brain haemorrhage four days after her birth in December 2001, when he was the chancellor. She died when she was 11 days old. \n\nGordon Brown, the former prime minister, has spoken out against the legalisation of assisted dying. He believes that the death of his newborn daughter, Jennifer, in January 2002, has made him realise the importance of good end-of-life care. Brown and his wife, Sarah, spent time at their baby\u2019s bedside as she passed away, and he considers those days to be among the most precious of their lives. In an article for the Guardian, Brown argues that the debate on assisted dying is moving too quickly, given the profound ethical and practical issues involved. He also points out that the state of the NHS makes it an unsuitable time for a far-reaching decision on the matter. Instead, Brown suggests that a commission should be set up to create a fully funded, 10-year strategy for improved and comprehensive palliative care. He references unpublished polling that shows half the public are not confident in the government\u2019s ability to fund specialist end-of-life care, and that more than two-thirds support the idea of a commission on the issue. \n\nMPs are set to vote next week on a private member\u2019s bill that would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. This vote will be a free vote, meaning that individual MPs, rather than their political parties, will decide whether to support or reject the bill. Supporters and opponents of the bill are expected to intensify their lobbying efforts over the next few days, as there is uncertainty surrounding the outcome of this historic vote. Brown emphasises that he and Sarah knew the extent of Jennifer\u2019s brain haemorrhage just four days after her birth in December 2001, when he was serving as chancellor. Jennifer passed away when she was just 11 days old. \n\nBrown\u2019s personal experience with the loss of his daughter has deeply influenced his views on end-of-life care. He believes that the emotional and ethical complexities of assisted dying are too significant to be addressed hastily. The state of the NHS, which he sees as already under strain, further complicates the issue. Brown advocates for a more measured approach, one that prioritises improving palliative care and ensuring that the government can adequately fund specialist end-of-life services. His call for a commission reflects a desire to address these issues comprehensively over a long period, rather than rushing into a decision that could have far-reaching consequences. \n\nThe upcoming vote on the assisted dying bill has sparked intense debate among MPs. The free vote system means that individual MPs will have to make their own decisions, which could lead to a divided House of Commons. Supporters of the bill argue that it would provide a compassionate option for those suffering from terminal illnesses, while opponents, like Brown, warn of the potential risks and ethical dilemmas. The polling data Brown cites highlights a significant public concern about the government\u2019s ability to fund specialist end-of-life care, suggesting that many people are wary of the implications of legalising assisted dying. As the vote approaches, the stakes are high, and the outcome could have a profound impact on the future of end-of-life care in the UK. \n\nIn conclusion, Gordon Brown\u2019s opposition to the legalisation of assisted dying is rooted in his personal experience with the loss of his daughter, Jennifer. He believes that the debate on assisted dying is moving too quickly and that the state of the NHS makes it an unsuitable time for a far-reaching decision. Instead, Brown advocates for a commission to develop a fully funded, 10-year strategy for improved palliative care. His call for a more measured approach reflects a desire to address the ethical and practical issues involved in assisted dying comprehensively. The upcoming vote on the assisted dying bill has sparked intense debate, with supporters and opponents increasing their lobbying efforts as the outcome remains uncertain. Brown\u2019s personal story and his call for a commission highlight the complexity of the issue and the need for careful consideration before making any decisions. \n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"]}], "tstamp": 1755255347.2882278, "total_output_tokens": 1137, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

The film felt like a desperate attempt to recapture the magic that once defined Disney, but it fell short, leaving audiences feeling like they\u2019d seen it all before. The release of *Spellbound*, another princess musical, only reinforced this sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.

The same goes for its director, Vicky Jenson, and its music by Alan Menken, an Oscar-winning composer known for *The Little Mermaid* and *Aladdin*. Yet, there\u2019s nothing in *Spellbound* to justify the star power and talent behind it.

The involvement of big-name actors and directors doesn\u2019t seem to make up for the lack of creativity and polish in these films. Instead, they feel like cheap imitations of Disney\u2019s past successes, leaving audiences wondering where the magic has gone.  \n\nThe text also touches on the broader issue of how Disney\u2019s brand has evolved over the years. Once a studio known for its high-quality, imaginative storytelling, it now seems to be producing films that feel more like cash grabs than artistic endeavors. The release of *Spellbound* on Netflix, a platform known for its diverse and often low-budget content, further emphasizes this shift. It\u2019s as if Disney is trying to fit into a different universe\u2014one that\u2019s far removed from the grand, magical world it once created.  \n\nIn the end, the text serves as a reminder of how much Disney has changed since its early days. While the studio still has a massive fan base and a rich history of iconic films, its recent output feels like a shadow of its former self. The feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that comes with *Wish* and *Spellbound* is a testament to how far Disney has strayed from the magic that once defined it.  \n\nIs there anything else I can help with?\""]}], "tstamp": 1755255388.6800544, "total_output_tokens": 741, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

I run a small-scale dairy farm in partnership with my son. We own just over 80 acres and rent another 40 acres annually. This allows us to have a herd of up to 80 milking cows but, despite misguided government assurances, leaves us now vulnerable to the new inheritance tax (IHT) proposals and will make our farm non-viable for the next generation. The average price of land in Northern Ireland is around \u00a315,000 an acre and to maintain a dairy herd it is essential to upgrade facilities, machinery and the quality of livestock. This necessitates frequently borrowing money and results in very poor cashflow. Farmers like me never expect to become millionaires in terms of realising the value of the land and other assets. We have a simple goal in life \u2013 to earn enough money to raise our families and to leave the farm in better shape than we got it. Farmers always encounter problems, be it daily issues on the farm, bureaucracy and regulation, the need to consider and mitigate against climate change, rocketing input costs, or the fact that farmers cannot themselves determine the price they receive for their produce. The ability to ensure farm family inheritance is critical if farmers are to continue, and thousands of jobs here in Northern Ireland depend on farmers.\n-------\n\nThe farmer is responding to an editorial in The Guardian that suggests big landowners should pay more taxes. While he agrees with the general idea, he points out that the new inheritance tax (IHT) could make it difficult for small-scale farmers like him to pass the farm on to the next generation. He runs a dairy farm with his son, owning 80 acres and renting 40 more, which allows them to keep up to 80 cows. However, the IHT could make the farm unviable for the next generation. He explains that maintaining a dairy farm requires constant upgrades to facilities, machinery, and livestock, which often means borrowing money and struggling with cash flow. The farmer\u2019s goal is simply to support his family and leave the farm in better condition than he found it. He also highlights the many challenges farmers face, such as daily issues, regulations, climate change, rising costs, and the inability to set their own prices.

It was a reminder of the beauty in life and the importance of friendship. I hope their connection continues and that it brought some warmth to my day. Chris Parsons, Hoopers Bridge, Cornwall\n\nI was struck by two headlines in the Guardian.
