Against her wishes, he then insisted she stay in the room overnight, sleep in his bed - despite her saying she would use the sofa - and initiated sexual contact with her. \"She felt trapped in that situation and what she was made to do was against her wishes.

The development came in the wake of filings from prosecutors and defense lawyers over their views of how Trump's case should proceed after he won the 2024 election against Kamala Harris. Trump's lawyers on Tuesday asked Merchan to throw out the case, contending that dismissal was necessary \"in order to facilitate the orderly transition of executive power\". Todd Blanche, Trump's lead attorney and choice for deputy US attorney general, and Emil Bove, the president-elect's pick for principal associate deputy attorney general, complained that the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg's team \"appears to not yet be ready to dismiss this politically motivated and fatally flawed case, which is what is mandated by the law and will happen as justice takes its course\". They argued that the US justice department was on the verge of dismissing Trump's federal cases and pointed to a departmental memo that bars prosecution of sitting presidents. \"As in those cases, dismissal is necessary here,\" their filing said. \"Just as a sitting president is completely immune from any criminal process, so too is President Trump as president-elect.\" They claimed that if this case proceeds, it would \"be uniquely destabilizing\" and could \"hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs\"."]}], "tstamp": 1755050902.7417674, "total_output_tokens": 365, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4", "api_kwargs": null}}
