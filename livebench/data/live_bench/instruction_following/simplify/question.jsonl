The former German chancellor, who during Trump\u2019s first term was given by some observers the designation of \u201cleader of the free world\u201d usually reserved for US presidents, said 16 years in power had taught her that business and political interests must be kept in fine balance.

Merkel said the SpaceX and Tesla chief\u2019s financial entanglements made such an appointment highly problematic. \u201cIf a person like him is the owner of 60% of all satellites orbiting in space, then that must be a huge concern for us along with the political issues,\u201d she said. \u201cPolitics must determine the social balance between the powerful and ordinary citizens.\u201d She noted that in the 2007-08 financial crisis during her first term as German chancellor, \u201cthe political sphere was the final authority that could straighten things out\u201d with measures such as bailouts coupled with new regulations. \u201cAnd if this final authority is too strongly influenced by companies, whether through capital power or technological capabilities, then this is an unprecedented challenge for us all,\u201d said Merkel, whose 700-plus-page tome will be released on Tuesday. She said one of the benchmarks setting free societies apart was clear checks on corporate power and the sway of the ultra-rich. \u201cIn a democracy, politics is never powerless against companies,\u201d she said.

The findings, which come as the province of Ontario goes to war over cycling infrastructure in Toronto, undercut claims that the dedicated routes contribute to urban gridlock. The leak comes as the provincial government further intensified the stakes of the battle by shielding itself from any lawsuits arising from the death or injury of cyclists on roads where the bike lanes were removed. Critics have described the last-minute move as an admission by the province that \u201cpeople will get hurt\u201d. Ontario\u2019s premier, Doug Ford, kicked off the row last month when he announced he would remove three of the city\u2019s main bike routes. Ford, who commutes on a road shared with one of those bike lanes, said the protected lanes were major factors in the \u201cinsanity\u201d of traffic congestion in Canada\u2019s largest city. But the internal draft document appears to undercut the premier\u2019s rationale. The cabinet briefing memo, first reported by the Trillium, suggests that removing bike lanes \u201cmay not reduce congestion as most research (eg New York, Washington, Vancouver) suggests reducing road capacity by introducing bike lanes can encourage biking and discourage car use, alleviating congestion\u201d. Staff who prepared the briefing also warned that Ontario \u201cmay be seen as encroaching on municipal decision-making authority\u201d and risks \u201cjeopardizing progress\u201d on long-term deals made with Toronto and Ottawa on financial stability. The Toronto city council is vehemently opposed to the plan and last week voted 21-4 to oppose a provincial bill that would grant Ontario the power to block planned cycle paths that remove traffic lanes.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

In a TV interview on Friday, South Korea\u2019s top security adviser, Shin Won-sik, suggested the Kremlin had started to fulfil its side of a deal to provide the regime in Pyongyang with technology and aid as \u201cpayment\u201d for the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops to Ukraine. \u201cIt has been identified that equipment and anti-aircraft missiles aimed at reinforcing Pyongyang\u2019s vulnerable air-defence system have been delivered to North Korea,\u201d Shin, the national security adviser to the South\u2019s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, told the broadcaster SBS. Shin did not offer details of how intelligence officials had confirmed the arrival in North Korea of Russian military support, and North Korea and the Kremlin have not commented on his claims. North Korea had also received \u201cvarious forms of economic support\u201d and may have acquired Russian technology for its troubled spy satellite programme, Shin said. North Korea claimed it had put its first spy satellite into orbit in November last year after two failed attempts, but experts have questioned whether it is able to produce imagery that could be useful to the country\u2019s military. Another satellite launch in May also ended in failure. Experts believe North Korea agreed to send troops to the western Kursk border region in return for military technology, ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, as well as possible security guarantees from Moscow.

Instead of a yes/no vote in parliament, Brown writes that a commission to devise a \u201cfully funded, 10-year strategy for improved and comprehensive palliative care\u201d should be set up. He cites unpublished polling showing that half the public are not confident of the government\u2019s ability to fund specialist end-of-life care, and that more than two-thirds back a commission on the issue. MPs are due to vote next week on a private member\u2019s bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales.

The Israeli prime minister and the defence minister he sacked a fortnight ago, Yoav Gallant, are now wanted men, the subject of arrest warrants issued on Thursday by the international criminal court (ICC), accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. From now on, some 124 countries are effectively closed to them: if Netanyahu or Gallant set foot in any member state of the ICC \u2013 which includes Britain and most of Europe \u2013 they face the risk of arrest. The UK government has already said it will follow the law, which sounds like a commitment to detain the two men if they come here. They are to be shunned, as a matter of international law. Israeli ministers and their allies are raging against the ICC, accusing it of bias and double standards in levelling against Israel charges that it has never made against the leaders of any other western democracy. But the blame lies squarely with Netanyahu himself. Because this move, which signals a new isolation of Israel, was entirely avoidable. Start with the law. Ask why the ICC didn\u2019t go after, say, Britain for suspected war crimes in Iraq or the US on similar charges in Afghanistan, and you\u2019ll be told that the ICC stays out of countries that have their own, reliable systems of justice.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The chancellor is understood to be determined not to drop the policy even though some Labour MPs \u2013 and even ministers \u2013 are worrying about the political fallout of the policy that has led to farmers protesting in Westminster this week. The Treasury has been assessing ways to mitigate the impact of changes, including amending gifting rules for those aged 80 and above so they can pass on their farms to their family without having to live for another seven years. Officials have also been looking at the impact of changes announced in the budget in October on active small- and medium-sized farms compared with smallholdings.

Despite the Treasury\u2019s insistence, some Labour MPs still believe the policy will be softened.

Nearly 20 years ago, at 19 years of age, at the end of a night out together, we argued and I pushed her. \u201cShe fell over and she was hurt.

The beauty of director Chelsea Walker\u2019s production is that it exposes the clashing human desires in the drama rather than attempting to paste over them. Humour sits beside unease and crisscrossing romantic passions are laid bare. Helena becomes Helen (Ruby Bentall) in this sleek modern-dress production, and is a smart, sympathetic character who is victim to her own obsessive love for Bertram (Kit Young). He presents as a social snob in refusing to marry her, but there is more to it than that: his male bonding with Paroles (William Robinson) does not so much contain homoerotic undercurrents as over-currents, with full-on snogs. Yet his physical attraction to Diana (Georgia-Mae Myers), the virgin daughter he meets in Italy, seems genuine, too. So a kind of love triangle lies within this production. If Paroles betrays Bertram during his gulling, Paroles, in turn, appears hurt by Bertram\u2019s betrayal of their desire for each other, through his dalliance with Diana, and eventual marriage to Helen.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Matt Gaetz removed himself after just eight days with Meyers joking that \u201conce again, he can\u2019t even make it to 18\u201d. The \u201caccused sexual predator\u201d had already been in the centre of a scandal involving sex with a 17-year-old and was now being accused of the same thing with another teenager.

He added: \u201cEven by Trump\u2019s degraded standards, his staffing picks have been obscene.\u201d He said that Trump had been going for the \u201cbiggest creeps\u201d and returned to Gaetz who was accused of \u201csex trafficking through Venmo\u201d which, if nothing else, is \u201cdeeply lazy\u201d.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply \u201cunworkable\u201d, Ford said. Someone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year. \u201cFord believes that figures lower than Department for Transport\u2019s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,\u201d it said at the time. \u201cFurthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.\u201d The carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars. During the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 with interest rates at rock bottom \u2013 carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts).

Developed in the shadow of the subgenre-restarting phenomenon that was Frozen, it was a soulless regurgitation that showed how a certain magic had become so hard to conjure in a kingdom that used to be so full of it. There\u2019s the overwhelming feeling of deja vu with the release of Spellbound \u2013 another princess musical about magic led by the voice of an actor from Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story with songs written by a once-esteemed award winner out on the exact same day \u2013 and while expectations are lower with a Netflix animation, the takeaway remains the same. They just don\u2019t make \u2019em like they used to. In the case of Spellbound, that\u2019s distractingly clear from the outset. The film, announced back in 2017 with Paramount before changing titles twice, moving from multiple release dates and shifting to Apple and then Netflix, looks every bit the sold-down-the-pub knock-off, plagued with animation far cheaper than we\u2019re used to outside of low-rent kids TV. It\u2019s not quite Cocomelon but it exists in an entirely other universe far, far away from the many Disney films it\u2019s trying to file itself next to. You\u2019d be easily fooled by the names involved though. Voices include Rachel Zegler, Nicole Kidman, Javier Bardem and John Lithgow; it\u2019s produced by the Toy Story director and ex-Pixar chief, John Lasseter; directed by Shrek\u2019s Vicky Jenson and music is from the Oscar-winner Alan Menken, whose credits include The Little Mermaid and Aladdin.

It proved to be perfect moviegoing weather outside: absolutely miserable with hard, cold rain.

By day four, when the extent of her brain haemorrhage had been diagnosed, we were fully aware that all hope was gone and that she had no chance of survival. We could only sit with her, hold her tiny hand and be there for her as life ebbed away. She died in our arms. But those days we spent with her remain among the most precious days of my and Sarah\u2019s lives. The experience of sitting with a fatally ill baby girl did not convince me of the case for assisted dying; it convinced me of the value and imperative of good end-of-life care. We were reassured that she was not in pain. At the heart of the debate on assisted dying is our desire to prevent suffering. Almost every family is able to talk from firsthand experience of heartbreaking moments when they want to do their best by their parents, grandparents or mortally ill children \u2013 and then feel they have failed. Our sympathies naturally flow to those fatally sick patients we know who themselves fear the suffering that lies ahead of them and losing control over their final months, days, or even hours.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The bill says only someone who has an \u201cinevitably progressive illness, disease or medical condition which cannot be reversed by treatment\u201d and whose death \u201ccan reasonably be expected within six months\u201d will be eligible for an assisted death. Most doctors agree that it is difficult to predict with accuracy when someone will die from a terminal illness. With cancer, prognosis is usually based on the type and stage of the disease, survival statistics, plus age and other health factors. Doctors usually give patients a range of time, but add that the person could die more quickly or live longer. Critics of assisted dying say doctors may feel under pressure to give a prognosis of which they cannot be certain.

The geopolitical backdrop to the current threat against undersea cables is the Russian invasion of Ukraine, China\u2019s behaviour towards Taiwan, and the Israel-Gaza war, but they have long been an obvious target.

He said: \u2018Sit down. You are never going to be the next Jeremy Clarkson, you know.\u2019 I was basically being warned off.\u201d Relations barely improved when Berry gave an interview to the now defunct News of the World in which he jokily suggested it would suit him if Clarkson would \u201cfall into a hole in the ground so I can have his job\u201d. The paper splashed it. \u201cSo that morning, his ex-wife Francie \u2013 who was the power behind the throne, she\u2019s the one who made him what he is today \u2013 rang me up and lambasted me: \u2018What is this in the News of the World? How can you possibly say this?\u2019 I said: \u2018I did say it but they have moved the words around to make it look really bad.\u2019 She was going on and I said: \u2018Francie, can I stop you?\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

He has promised to conduct mass deportations and raids as a part of a far-right approach to US immigration. And he is expected to roll back data collection practices on police misconduct and stifle any hope of passing police reform in Congress \u2013 specifically the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

Joe Biden\u2019s actions in his remaining time in office could be a crucial buttress against the expected impacts of the next four years.

Sex would be redefined \u201cin such a manner that actually eradicates trans people\u201d, said Redfield, and would not allow for \u201cself-identification\u201d. \u201cThe definition of sex that they would propose is that sex is defined based on anatomical characteristics at birth and is unchangeable.\u201d The definition of sex is \u201cat the core of some of the biggest civil rights conversations we\u2019re having in the LGBTQ+ context\u201d, said Redfield.

That such measures would drastically upend the lives of the US\u2019s immigrant communities is widely understood. But sweeping anti-immigrant policies would also be detrimental to American citizens \u2013 most notably the nearly 20 million US-born children of immigrant parents. \u201cMass deportations will be profoundly harmful to US citizen children,\u201d said Andrew Craycroft, staff attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco. In 2022, one in four US children had at least one immigrant parent, and more than 4 million US citizens under age 18 lived with an undocumented parent. \u201cThese are millions of US citizen children who were born here, who have grown up going to your elementary schools and playing on your little league baseball teams, who are facing a very real danger of losing their parents,\u201d said Kelly Albinak Kribs, co-director of the Technical Assistance Program at the Young Center for Immigrant Children\u2019s Rights. And while the mechanics by which the president-elect would actually execute his sweeping anti-immigrant agenda remain murky, there is little doubt that creating a climate of fear for immigrant communities is one of his administration\u2019s top priorities \u2013 and one that will cause irreparable psychological damage to millions of US citizens. *** Deporting the parents of US-citizen children didn\u2019t begin with Trump. However, past administrations took precautions to limit the trauma it caused, advocates and legal experts say.

It\u2019s the creation of American entrepreneur Raj Bhakta, who in 2020 began buying up aged armagnac, and the name is a mischievous dig at his former company WhistlePig, a rye whiskey distiller in Vermont that he left in 2019. As you can imagine, Bhakta has ruffled a few feathers by combining rare 42-year-old brandies with young bourbons \u2013 and that\u2019s even before we get on to the accompanying sales pitch video, which can only be described as Trumpian. Dog\u2019s dinner or pig\u2019s ear, the idea behind Hogsworth does point to something interesting going on in the spirits world: mature whisky, be it single malt scotch or bourbon, can be extremely valuable. Armagnac, by contrast, isn\u2019t. If you\u2019re looking for a 40th birthday present, you could buy, say, a 1984 Delord armagnac for \u00a3125.65 (from Brandy Classics, 40%), or you could go very large indeed and splash out nearly \u00a35,000 on a bottle of Glenfarclas Winter Cask 1984 (Master of Malt, 47.1%). I went to Armagnac in south-west France a few years ago, and was stunned by the quality of the spirits I found there. As Jerome Delord of the eponymous producer explained: \u201cWe have been sleeping on our laurels for too long.\u201d Armagnac lives in the shadow of Cognac, its big brother to the north, which makes about 180m bottles a year compared with Armagnac\u2019s 6m. Cognac is export-led and dominated by four big producers, whereas half of all armagnac produced is sold in France. It\u2019s also made largely by farmers who might also keep cows, make wine and grow tobacco, whereas cognac is a monoculture: most cognac uses one grape variety, ugni blanc, whereas in an armagnac there are 10 varieties.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Miguel Altunaga plays a reporter sent to describe it, and the tone at first is wickedly funny as Altunaga \u2013 a pitch perfect combination of intrusive and bewildered \u2013 tries to make sense of what\u2019s happening. \u201cAmazing energy,\u201d he pronounces as the group rock through a happy-clappy ensemble. Then as the group divide into individual solos, contorting their bodies into expressions of private feeling, he trails after the dancers, hoping for elucidation. One of them, her limbs tied into an agonised knot, explains breathlessly that she\u2019s dancing about the \u201cstigma of addiction\u201d. Another, his eyes rolling back in his head with exertion, says he\u2019s expressing a sense of betrayal. It\u2019s a brilliant riff on the worst cliches of interpretative modern dance but Duke is soon flipping the work into something deeper, darker and more personal.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Following another day of debate about the bill, which seeks to transpose EU statute into UK law post-Brexit, the government faced possible defeat over amendments intended to maintain the scope of the EU charter on fundamental rights. Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat. However, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, said the government was willing to work with Grieve to see how rights under the charter could be kept after Brexit, and would introduce its own amendment to this effect later in the bill\u2019s passage. Grieve said this was sufficient reassurance for him and that he would not press for a vote on his amendments. Ken Clarke, another leading Conservative Brexit rebel, refused to guarantee he would not press for a vote on one amendment, which would allow Britons to mount legal challenges under the charter after Brexit, to which he was the second signatory after Grieve. However, with Grieve backing away, the chances of a government defeat were notably lessened if a vote was called. Buckland said he did not fully agree with Grieve\u2019s amendment, which would allow challenges to EU law retained after Brexit \u201con the grounds that it is in breach of general principles of EU law\u201d, and questioned whether it would add anything \u201cthat is relevant or material\u201d to existing rights. But Buckland said: \u201cLet me say that we do recognise the strength of views from my right honourable friend and, indeed, from other honourable members and honourable friends on this issue \u2013 many of whom have spoken this afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re listening, and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach that can command the support of this house.\u201d Buckland said he would happily discuss a way forward with Grieve, \u201cand agree to work together with us in this shared endeavour\u201d, which would result in a government amendment in the report stage, the next part of the bill\u2019s passage through the Commons.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the First Folio, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today. Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul\u2019s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies. In the words of one critic: \u201cIt is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.\u201d The book now known as the First Folio (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare\u2019s plays) established \u201cShakespeare\u201d for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some 36 plays, including 18 scripts (notably Macbeth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It and The Tempest) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox). Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be \u201cthe soul of the age\u201d) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of \u201cShakespeare studies\u201d. Other facts about the First Folio, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare\u2019s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books\u2019 sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections).\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladi\u0107, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladi\u0107 is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The Electoral Commission has noted, in documents seen by the Guardian, that Darren Grimes, who was 23 at the time, was apparently able to coordinate large sums to be spent with a social media marketing firm before receiving official confirmation of the amounts Vote Leave were intending to give him. Vote Leave, Grimes and a third group, Veterans for Britain, are under investigation by the election regulator over referendum spending. It was not against election rules for Vote Leave to donate to Grimes or other third parties as long as the spending was not coordinated. The watchdog reopened its investigation after an early decision not to take action was due to be challenged in a judicial review next month. A document submitted by the commission as part of the review process reveals the relationship between Vote Leave and Grimes. It describes how Grimes told Vote Leave on 13 June last year he would like to use a donation offered at an unknown date the previous week on a digital campaign with Aggregate IQ. The referendum was held 10 days later. Vote Leave told Grimes on 14 June that it had decided to donate \u00a3400,000 to him, the day after Vote Leave itself received a \u00a31m donation, and Grimes provided his AIQ reference number for the payment to be made directly. \u201cIt appears Mr Grimes was in a position to make arrangements with AIQ to provide services to him on 13 June ... before receiving confirmation of the amount to be donated,\u201d the review said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggests that being left-handed is a particular advantage in interactive sports where time pressures are particularly severe, such as table tennis and cricket \u2013 possibly because their moves are less familiar to their mostly right-handed opponents, who do not have time to adjust. \u201cThe data suggests that the heavier the time constraints are operating in a sport, the larger the proportion of left-handers,\u201d said the study\u2019s author, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. \u201cWe are less used to playing lefties, and [so] might end up in not developing the optimal strategies to compete with them.\u201d While it is thought that about 10-13% of the population is left-handed, it has long been noted that in certain interactive sports there is often a surprisingly high proportion of left-handers playing at elite levels. Southpaw stars have seen significant success in sport, with big names including baseball aces Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson, cricketers Garfield Sobers and Mitchell Johnson and table tennis\u2019s Wang Nan and Kasumi Ishikawa. Previous research has punted a number of possible explanations, including that left-handers have more efficient connections between the two hemispheres of their brain. Others have suggested that lefties have the edge due to an element of surprise: since most players are right-handed, players will be more used to playing against right-handed partners. But the question remained: why did different sports show such different proportions of left-handed players? To probe the issue, Loffing collected the names and handedness of the top 100 or so players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis and \u2013 for men only \u2013 cricket and baseball, across six years between 2009 and 2014.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It\u2019s problematic in a number of ways. Firstly, very little of it involves what most people would recognise as archaeology \u2013 digging up cultural material from the ground for study. Most of the material legacies of modern conflicts remain above ground and embedded in current society, necessitating a more anthropological, interdisciplinary approach. Secondly, the time periods under study are often within living memory, and often remain highly contentious within the affected regions. This means that modern conflict archaeology can be a political minefield \u2013 as well as an actual minefield.

That total comfortably beats the 931,000 copies of \u00f7 sold by Ed Sheeran since he released it in early March. Swift has kept all but four songs from Reputation off streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, meaning that fans need to pay to download the album or buy it on CD if they want to hear it. She also, somewhat controversially, created a promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album increased their chances of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, thus further driving sales. Nielsen, which collates album sales data in the US, said that Reputation sold more copies than the rest of the top 200 albums put together. Swift\u2019s previous three albums have all sold more than a million copies in the US in their first week\u2013 a feat increasingly difficult to achieve as the popularity of downloads and CDs continues to wane. Her label Big Machine reported that a further 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, 84,000 of which were in the UK, which gives it the sixth-largest first week UK sales of the year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag\u2019N\u2019Bone Man and Swift\u2019s friend Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of \u00f7 in the first week of its release.

As the UK\u2019s historic decision to quit the EU plays out, it doesn\u2019t take much for the softly spoken 78-year-old and five-times rally-driving champion to cast his mind back to the days when customs posts and army checkpoints brought life in the picturesque village of Pettigo to a halt. \u201cWe had about half a dozen incendiary bombs before the big one,\u201d he says, tilting his chin to the other classic-cars garage across the road, now run by his son. \u201cThat blew the garage right into the river.\u201d Pettigo is unique in Ireland as it is the only village divided by the border after Ireland gained independence from Britain in 1922. The river that runs beneath his workshop window places Johnston\u2019s Protestant family in Northern Ireland and his largely Catholic neighbours on the other side of the 1820s cut-stone bridge in the republic of Ireland. This village has seen more than its fair share of pain. Just to be associated with Britain during the Troubles of the late 60s to 90s was to be a target. \u201cOne day, a couple of IRA men came to the garage. I was held at gunpoint. They walked me up the road and held me at the customs post,\u201d he says, pointing to the stone wall outside his garage.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

According to the Financial Times, students working at the Foxconn plant, as part of a three month \u201cwork experience\u201d placement, were routinely working 11-hour days assembling the newest phone, breaking Chinese overtime laws in the process. Student labour is common, and legal, in manufacturing hubs in China. The students must be paid, and the placements must be voluntary, with the number of temporary workers swelling employment at the Zhengzhou factory threefold in the busiest time of the year, the paper reported. But, according to the Financial Times, such work experience should be limited to just 40 hours a week. Six high school students, out of a group of 3,000 from one vocational school sent to work at the factory, told the paper that those legal limits were exceeded. In a statement, Apple said: \u201cDuring the course of a recent audit, we discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We\u2019ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime.\u201d \u201cAt this facility, student intern programs are short term and account for a very small percentage of the workforce. When we found that some students were allowed to work overtime, we took prompt action.

The actors wear cartoonish theatrical makeup, which extends to cover their clothes and all the objects and furnishings that surround them. This, in itself, is arresting and strange. Somewhere between the avant garde and the amateur, between theatre and cartoon, history lesson and literature class, their films are equally curious in their subject matter.

The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers \u00a330bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding \u00a310-\u00a315 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers\u2019 interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from \u00a36bn to \u00a330bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change \u2013 now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \u2013 did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: \u201cBillpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.\u201d The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK\u2019s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a \u201crisky and expensive project\u201d.

Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his \u201cinexplicable failure\u201d. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui\u2019s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui\u2019s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a \u201cdriven young man\u201d aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. \u201cWhilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui\u2019s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,\u201d Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

In Westminster it is known as aligning the economic and political cycles.

And if there\u2019s one thing the Scots are good at, apart from politics, economics, terriers and whisky, it\u2019s an honest broth. According to the Victorian journalist and author Christian Isobel Johnstone, who published her The Cook and Housewife\u2019s Manual under the pseudonym Margaret Dods: \u201cThe French take the lead of all European people in soups and broths \u2026 the Scotch rank second, the Welsh next, and \u2026 the English, as a nation, are at the very bottom of the scale.\u201d As an Edinburgh native, she may have been biased, but when one considers the likes of cullen skink, Scotch broth and our subject here, cock-a-leekie, it\u2019s hard not to concede the point. The last, occasionally known as cockie-leekie, is often dated to the end of the 16th century, when the Lincolnshire-born traveller Fynes Moryson records having been served \u201cpullet with some prunes in the broth\u201d at a knight\u2019s house in Scotland, although, given the widespread medieval tradition of meat and fruit pottages, it seems likely that similar dishes were once found throughout northern Europe \u2013 even (horror!) south of the border. Happily for us, however, this particular version remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls \u201can auld boiling fowl\u201d (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that \u201cattempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chicken is akin to attempting cassoulet without confit\u201d, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using \u201ca more flavourful pheasant or other game bird \u2013 cock or hen \u2013 which has roamed freely\u201d. Having tried her recipe, I can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but one with a distinct gamey character.

In a statement, the CBS News president, David Rhodes, said his behavior was \u201cextremely disturbing and intolerable\u201d. \u201cWhat may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable.\u201d Rose said in a statement on Monday: \u201cI am greatly embarrassed.

The show had opened with a straight news report on a story that now involved their own station. A CBS This Morning reporter related the facts that Rose, 75, had been suspended from his job while the company looks into detailed accusations from eight women that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards them, as revealed by the Washington Post. Allegations include lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, and the women were employees or aspired to work for Rose at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011, the Post reported. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage for these women to come forward,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Shortly before legislators met, the man expected to succeed him broke more than a week of silence to add his voice to those calling for the ageing leader to step down. Emmerson Mnangagwa, until recently Mugabe\u2019s vice-president and right hand man, urged the nonagenarian leader to \u201caccept the will of the people\u201d.

Yet from poinsettias to potted Christmas trees, many of these festive favourites can be extremely hard to keep alive in the conditions of the average living room for just a few weeks, let alone year to year. There is, however, a really old-school, and often overlooked, seasonal houseplant that is made from much tougher stuff: the beautiful and exotic Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata and S x buckleyi). These two species (which look so similar that they share a common name) hail from the cool mountains of southeastern Brazil, where they are pollinated by hummingbirds. Unusually for a cactus, they aren\u2019t a desert plant, but have adapted to grow on the boughs of tall rainforest trees, festooning their branches with weeping foliage and dazzling flowers. This relatively cool-weather habitat is surprisingly similar to the conditions of our British living rooms, making them perfectly adapted to thrive in hanging baskets or trail over windowsills everywhere. But what does a cactus have to do with Christmas? Not a great deal, really. In fact, in their native habitat their winter-flowering period doesn\u2019t even coincide with Christmas. However, fortunately for gardeners like me, their habit of bursting into the most spectacular of floral displays from November to January occurs just when I need it most.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.
