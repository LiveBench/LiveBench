I run a small-scale dairy farm in partnership with my son. We own just over 80 acres and rent another 40 acres annually. This allows us to have a herd of up to 80 milking cows but, despite misguided government assurances, leaves us now vulnerable to the new inheritance tax (IHT) proposals and will make our farm non-viable for the next generation. The average price of land in Northern Ireland is around \u00a315,000 an acre and to maintain a dairy herd it is essential to upgrade facilities, machinery and the quality of livestock. This necessitates frequently borrowing money and results in very poor cashflow. Farmers like me never expect to become millionaires in terms of realising the value of the land and other assets. We have a simple goal in life \u2013 to earn enough money to raise our families and to leave the farm in better shape than we got it. Farmers always encounter problems, be it daily issues on the farm, bureaucracy and regulation, the need to consider and mitigate against climate change, rocketing input costs, or the fact that farmers cannot themselves determine the price they receive for their produce. The ability to ensure farm family inheritance is critical if farmers are to continue, and thousands of jobs here in Northern Ireland depend on farmers.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Answer: The jury found that McGregor assaulted Hand, who had accused him of raping her at a hotel in Dublin in December 2018. McGregor was ordered to pay nearly \u20ac250,000 in damages to Hand. The jury deliberated for six hours and 10 minutes before reaching its verdict. Hand's lawyer told the jury that she had been referred to a sexual assault treatment unit the day after the alleged assault, and a doctor directed that photographs be taken of her injuries. McGregor denied the allegation and said that he had \"fully consensual sex\" with Hand. He also denied causing bruising to the plaintiff. Hand said that she and a friend made contact with McGregor, who she knew, after a work Christmas party. They were driven by McGregor to a party in a penthouse room of a south Dublin hotel where drugs and alcohol were consumed."}

Despite the Treasury\u2019s insistence, some Labour MPs still believe the policy will be softened.

Asked about the research into exempting those aged 80 and above from the policy, a No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to implementing the policy as set out in a budget.

By day four, when the extent of her brain haemorrhage had been diagnosed, we were fully aware that all hope was gone and that she had no chance of survival. We could only sit with her, hold her tiny hand and be there for her as life ebbed away. She died in our arms. But those days we spent with her remain among the most precious days of my and Sarah\u2019s lives. The experience of sitting with a fatally ill baby girl did not convince me of the case for assisted dying; it convinced me of the value and imperative of good end-of-life care. We were reassured that she was not in pain. At the heart of the debate on assisted dying is our desire to prevent suffering. Almost every family is able to talk from firsthand experience of heartbreaking moments when they want to do their best by their parents, grandparents or mortally ill children \u2013 and then feel they have failed. Our sympathies naturally flow to those fatally sick patients we know who themselves fear the suffering that lies ahead of them and losing control over their final months, days, or even hours.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

It\u2019s the creation of American entrepreneur Raj Bhakta, who in 2020 began buying up aged armagnac, and the name is a mischievous dig at his former company WhistlePig, a rye whiskey distiller in Vermont that he left in 2019. As you can imagine, Bhakta has ruffled a few feathers by combining rare 42-year-old brandies with young bourbons \u2013 and that\u2019s even before we get on to the accompanying sales pitch video, which can only be described as Trumpian.

Cognac is export-led and dominated by four big producers, whereas half of all armagnac produced is sold in France. It\u2019s also made largely by farmers who might also keep cows, make wine and grow tobacco, whereas cognac is a monoculture: most cognac uses one grape variety, ugni blanc, whereas in an armagnac there are 10 varieties.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.
