The new recriminalization law, HB4002, will give those caught with illicit drugs \u2013 including fentanyl, heroin and meth \u2013 the choice to either be charged with possession or treatment, which includes completing a behavioral health program and participating in a \u201cdeflection program\u201d to avoid fines. Personal-use possession would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. It aims to make it easier for police to crack down on drug use in public and introduced harsher penalties for selling drugs near places such as parks. The recriminalization law encourages, but does not mandate, counties to create treatment alternatives to divert people from the criminal justice system and toward addiction and mental health services. Backers of the law say this allows counties to develop programs based on their resources, while opponents say it may create a confusing and inequitable patchwork of policy. \u201cThe criteria is very narrow to meet deflection: no other charges, no warrants, no violent behavior, medically stable,\u201d said Portland police chief Bob Day. If a person meets the requirements for deflection, officers will call the county\u2019s deflection dispatch line to provide basic information, determine eligibility and connect them to a mobile behavioral health outreach team that will have 30 minutes to make contact. \u201cIf the behavioral health people cannot be there within 30 minutes, we\u2019re going to go to jail.

A new law, HB4002, will reinstate penalties for drug possession, offering individuals the option to face charges or participate in treatment programs. These programs include completing a behavioral health program and engaging in a \"deflection program\" to avoid fines. Possession of personal-use drugs will be classified as a misdemeanor, carrying a maximum penalty of six months in jail. The law also aims to increase police enforcement of drug use in public spaces and impose stricter penalties for drug sales near areas like parks. It encourages, though does not require, counties to develop treatment alternatives to divert individuals from the criminal justice system and toward addiction and mental health services. Supporters argue this allows for tailored programs based on local resources, while critics warn it could lead to inconsistent and unfair policies. Portland Police Chief Bob Day explained that deflection eligibility is limited to those with no other charges, no warrants, no violent behavior, and who are medically stable. If eligible, officers will contact a county\u2019s deflection dispatch line to connect individuals with a mobile behavioral health outreach team within 30 minutes. If the team cannot reach the individual in time, they will be taken to jail. Day emphasized the urgency of the process, stating, \"We\u2019re not able to just wait around.\" ***\n\nThe new law marks a significant shift in Oregon's drug policy, moving away from decriminalization to a more punitive approach. While it aims to address public safety concerns, it also raises questions about the effectiveness of treatment programs and the potential for increased incarceration. The deflection program, designed to divert individuals from the criminal justice system, may face challenges in implementation, particularly in ensuring timely access to behavioral health services. Critics argue that the law could create a patchwork of policies across counties, leading to inequities in how individuals are treated. Supporters, however, believe it provides a necessary framework for addressing drug use and addiction through a combination of enforcement and treatment. The law\u2019s impact on public health and criminal justice outcomes will likely be closely monitored in the coming years. ***\n\nThe expiration of Oregon\u2019s drug decriminalization experiment highlights the ongoing debate over the best approach to addressing drug use and addiction. While decriminalization was seen as a progressive step toward reducing stigma and encouraging treatment, the new law reflects a return to traditional punitive measures. The deflection program, which offers an alternative to incarceration, is a key component of the law, but its success will depend on the availability and effectiveness of behavioral health services. The law also introduces stricter penalties for drug sales near public spaces, aiming to reduce drug-related harm in these areas. However, critics argue that the law may disproportionately affect marginalized communities and fail to address the root causes of drug use. The law\u2019s implementation will be closely watched, as it could set a precedent for other states considering similar policies. ***\n\nIn conclusion, the new law in Oregon represents a significant change in the state\u2019s approach to drug policy, shifting from decriminalization to a more punitive framework. While it aims to enhance public safety and provide treatment alternatives, it also raises concerns about the potential for increased incarceration and inequities in implementation. The deflection program, designed to divert individuals from the criminal justice system, will be a critical factor in determining the law\u2019s success. As Oregon moves forward with this new approach, the broader implications for drug policy and public health will be closely examined. ***\n\nP.P.S: The law\u2019s impact on the **age** of individuals involved in drug-related offenses, the **country**\u2019s overall drug policy landscape, the **shopping** habits of those seeking treatment, and the **tongue** of public discourse on drug use will all be important considerations in the coming years."}

Carsley used this incident to illustrate how younger players can manage external pressures effectively. \"Not just Noni,\" Carsley noted, emphasizing that the entire generation of players from the Euros seems to handle stress with ease.\n\nCarsley's observations extend beyond individual performances. He noted a general atmosphere of calm and confidence among the younger players. For instance, during a pre-game dinner, he observed players engaging in light-hearted activities like dancing and playing table tennis, indicating a lack of pre-match anxiety. \"I was expecting them to be a bit nervous,\" he recalled, \"but instead, they were relaxed and focused.\"\n\nThought: The ability of these young players to remain composed under pressure is a testament to their maturity and mental strength. As they continue to develop, they will likely bring a fresh perspective and energy to the England team, helping to build a more resilient and dynamic squad for future challenges."}

The Dutchman is set to lead the club in his first season, and Robertson believes that a solid defensive performance will be crucial for Liverpool to mount a serious title challenge. The team has already shown promising signs, having kept clean sheets in their opening two matches. However, the upcoming game against Manchester United is expected to be a tougher test, as the Red Devils are known for their strong attacking prowess. Despite the challenges, Robertson remains optimistic, stating that the team has a good foundation to build upon.\n\nLast season, Liverpool's defense was a significant concern, as they conceded 41 goals in 38 matches, which was seven more than Manchester City, the champions, and 12 more than Arsenal, the runners-up. This defensive weakness ultimately cost them the title race, as they were often punished for conceding too many chances. However, the early signs this season have been encouraging, with the team managing to keep clean sheets in their first two games. Robertson acknowledged the progress made, saying, \"I think in the first two games, you\u2019ve seen that, two clean sheets, which we couldn\u2019t have asked for better.\" He added that the team hopes to maintain this form and limit Manchester United to fewer chances, as well as other teams after the international break.\n\nRobertson also reflected on the defensive struggles of the previous season, noting that even when Liverpool was still in the title race, they were conceding more chances than Arsenal and Manchester City. This inconsistency in defense often led to costly mistakes, which ultimately derailed their title hopes. He warned that if the team continues to concede too many chances, they will face similar setbacks. \"When you look back at last season\u2019s stats, I think even when we were still in the title race, we were conceding more chances probably than Arsenal and Man City. And when you do that, there\u2019s going to be a game where you get punished. And that\u2019s what ended up happening to us,\" he said. Robertson's comments highlight the need for the team to address their defensive vulnerabilities to ensure a successful campaign under Slot's leadership.\n\nP.S. The upcoming match against Manchester United will be a critical test for Liverpool's defense, as the team looks to build on their early-season success. Robertson's emphasis on limiting chances and maintaining a clean sheet underscores the importance of a strong defensive performance. As the season progresses, the team will need to address their defensive weaknesses to avoid the pitfalls that cost them the title last year. With Slot at the helm, Liverpool has the opportunity to improve significantly, but the early signs suggest that the team must remain vigilant and focused to achieve their goals."}

She clinched a bronze medal in a nail-biting shoot-off against her fellow British competitor, Phoebe Paterson Pine, who had previously won gold in Tokyo. The match was intense, with Paterson Pine maintaining a narrow lead until the final shot. She needed a perfect 10 to clinch the gold, a 9 to force a shoot-off, but instead, she hit an 8, leaving the crowd in disbelief. Grinham, visibly stunned, embraced her friend, who has been a training partner since their teenage years. \"I knew I needed a 10 to put pressure on her,\" Grinham reflected, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of sport, even when competing against a teammate. Grinham, known for her striking appearance and exceptional archery skills, has had to adapt her technique due to her pregnancy. She uses a specially designed quiver to accommodate her growing belly and wears flat shoes to maintain stability. The constant movement of her baby has also been a unique challenge, with the little kicks serving as a reminder of the support she carries within her. \"It\u2019s been a real honor to know that the baby is there, providing that little support bubble in my belly,\" she shared."}

However, I no longer hold that belief. My six-year journey of writing 260,000 words on the history of the human mind has led me to consider the possibility of a new path for humanity, one free from the terror that fuels violent nationalism, religious intolerance, and ideological madness. This experience has transformed me from a harbinger of doom into a resolute optimist. Our beliefs are the driving forces of history, and their origins can be traced back to the great prophets, theologians, and philosophers whose visions have captivated us for over 2,500 years. The history of war reveals with stark clarity how these beliefs\u2014no matter how irrational, fantastical, or unfounded\u2014have periodically seized the collective mind, propelling us into conflict, revolution, and chaos, and how we have consistently been willing to slaughter each other in the name of those beliefs. Sapiens began crafting axes and spears and engaging in warfare around 70,000-80,000 years ago in southern Africa. The concept of peaceful cooperation was foreign to those warring tribes. The Western conscience, the internal voice of restraint, is a relatively recent phenomenon in the grand timeline of human history. The mental arbiter of our moral actions emerged only about 5,000 years ago. Is there anything else I can help with? P.P.S."}

Now, in The Order, Kurzel turns his attention to American neo-Nazis, and the people who hunt them \u2013 and, in the shape of Jude Law\u2019s profoundly damaged FBI agent, the latter are not the cuddliest characters either. Premiering in competition at the Venice film festival, true-crime drama The Order is about the most dynamic thing seen on the Lido in the event\u2019s first few days, and affirms Kurzel\u2019s status as a formidable auteur, especially when it comes to the dark stuff. Scripted by Zach Baylin and based on the book The Silent Brotherhood by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, The Order recounts the early 80s hunt for a neo-Nazi militia group: a splinter faction from an extreme-right church, led by fanatics who want to stop praying and put the white supremacist agenda into murderous action. Law, who also produced, plays Terry Husk, the FBI man who arrives in the Pacific northwest to pursue the faction, while carrying scars from his career fighting the KKK and the mob; Tye Sheridan is a local cop who befriends him. But the most out-and-out Kurzelian role here is taken by Nicholas Hoult, who was so disturbingly serpentine in the director\u2019s True History of the Kelly Gang. Hoult plays the disarmingly named Bob Mathews, a blue-eyed angelic-faced country boy with a sweet smile, a heart of flint, and a ruthless agenda to establish an all-white promised land, to which end, he masterminds a set of bank robberies intended to finance a militia. The bible for his project is The Turner Diaries, an actual 1978 fiction-cum-tract which, closing titles tell us, has been used as a blueprint for American extreme-right actions right up to 2021\u2019s attack on the Capitol \u2013 although it\u2019s clear long before the film\u2019s end just how germane The Order is as a commentary on today\u2019s American fascism and its history. While highly effective as docudrama, The Order is also briskly compelling as a straight-down-the-line detective thriller, especially in its action sequences. In the hands of editor Nick Fenton, the robbery sequences \u2013 especially a road assault on a Brink\u2019s van \u2013 have a clean, propulsive urgency that recalls that of vintage thriller maestros like Michael Mann, William Friedkin and Sidney Lumet.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Now, in *The Order*, Kurzel shifts his focus to American neo-Nazis and the FBI agents tasked with hunting them. The film, which premiered in competition at the Venice Film Festival, is a gripping true-crime drama that solidifies Kurzel's reputation as a master of dark, intense storytelling. Based on the book *The Silent Brotherhood* by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, the film follows the early 1980s hunt for a neo-Nazi militia group, a splinter faction from an extreme-right church. The story centers on FBI agent Terry Husk, played by Jude Law, who arrives in the Pacific Northwest to pursue the group, leaving behind scars from his past battles with the KKK and the mob. Tye Sheridan co-stars as a local cop who forms an unlikely bond with Husk, while Nicholas Hoult delivers a chilling performance as Bob Mathews, a seemingly innocent country boy with a hidden agenda to establish an all-white utopia.\n\n*The Order* is both a compelling docudrama and a fast-paced detective thriller, particularly in its action sequences. The film\u2019s robbery scenes, especially a high-stakes assault on a Brink\u2019s van, are expertly edited by Nick Fenton, creating a sense of urgency and momentum reminiscent of classic thriller directors like Michael Mann, William Friedkin, and Sidney Lumet. The film\u2019s narrative is deeply relevant, as it draws parallels between the neo-Nazi movement of the 1980s and the rise of American fascism in recent years. The closing titles reveal that the book *The Turner Diaries*, which serves as the ideological blueprint for the film\u2019s characters, has been used as a guide for real-world extremist actions, including the 2021 Capitol attack. This connection underscores the film\u2019s timely commentary on the enduring threat of white supremacy and its historical roots.\n\nJustin Kurzel\u2019s *The Order* is a powerful and dynamic exploration of extremism, law enforcement, and the moral complexities of fighting a seemingly insurmountable evil. With its intense performances, sharp direction, and thought-provoking themes, the film stands out as one of the most compelling entries at the Venice Film Festival. It not only reaffirms Kurzel\u2019s status as a formidable auteur but also serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle against hate and violence in America."}

The Observer has learned that the country\u2019s leading charity for older people, Age UK, has written to Reeves with a specific proposal it believes will be fairer and that would prevent around two million pensioners being deprived of a payment it says they badly need. The UK chancellor revealed plans in July to introduce a means test for the winter fuel payment, where only those on pensions credit would qualify, as part of a push to plug what she said was a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances left by the previous Conservative administration. But many Labour MPs have reported being bombarded with complaints from constituents furious at the plan, which was not in Labour\u2019s election manifesto.

The issue is likely to be raised by both Labour and Tory MPs when parliament reconvenes after the summer recess on Monday. In a letter to Reeves, Age UK has put forward a detailed plan suggesting that, rather than limiting winter fuel payments to those on pension credit, the allowance should also be paid to two million more pensioners \u2013 those on a range of other benefits including housing benefit, council tax support, attendance allowance and carers\u2019 allowance.

England fancied they had a good \u2019un on their hands, although how good was still to be established. Twelve years on \u2013 a passage of time barely discernible from Root\u2019s boyish looks and sunny disposition \u2013 the going, like the answer to that latter question, was great. Just 48 hours after matching Alastair Cook\u2019s tally of 33 Test centuries for England, Root claimed the record outright, his second of the match lighting up a gloomy third day at Lord\u2019s and putting a series win over Sri Lanka within touching distance. There have been more taxing hundreds among this remarkable haul; days when Root has had to get the shovel out and dig England out of a hole. And it is true that the third innings of a Test match, when a massive lead has already been established and the follow-on eschewed, can often feel short on jeopardy as spectators wait for the final equation to be set and the start of a victory charge with the ball. But as the public filtered out of Lord\u2019s on Saturday evening, England having reduced Sri Lanka to 53 for two in their unlikely pursuit of 483 to level the series, no one was talking down what they had witnessed, other than a fair few grumbles about the bad light that forced the players off at 5.05pm. Two hours earlier Root had delivered an \u2018I was there\u2019 moment for them when, with 98 to his name and a short-ball plan in place, he stepped to leg and cut Lahiru Kumara through the off side for four. Cook was among those looking on from the Lord\u2019s media centre, more than happy to crown Root as \u201cquite simply England\u2019s greatest\u201d. The former opener will soon have to make way as the country\u2019s highest run-scorer in Test cricket, too, with Root, last man out for 103 in a total of 251, needing 96 more to eclipse his 12,472 runs.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Fast forward to 2023, and Root not only matched Alastair Cook\u2019s record of 33 Test centuries but also surpassed it, scoring a crucial 103 in the third innings at Lord\u2019s. While the third day of a Test match often feels less intense, Root\u2019s innings was anything but ordinary.

Set in the ancient city of Sicily, the story revolves around two unemployed potters who decide to co-direct a play performed by Athenian prisoners of war. The *New York Times* has praised the novel as a \"comic riff on Greek tragedy, with an Irish accent,\" while renowned author Roddy Doyle has described it as a tale of \"modern-day Dubliners living among ancient Greeks.\" Lennon shared his thoughts on the novel\u2019s origins during a conversation from his home in Norwich. He revealed that his fascination with ancient Greece began in his childhood, and this interest was further ignited when he read *History of the Peloponnesian War* by Thucydides. This historical account details the 27-year conflict between Athens and Sparta, which had far-reaching consequences across the Mediterranean. Lennon was particularly intrigued by Athens\u2019 unprovoked invasion of Sicily, primarily targeting Syracuse, the dominant power in the region. The Athenians believed the campaign would be swift and would bolster their position in Greece. However, the invasion turned into a catastrophic failure, resulting in the capture of thousands of Athenian prisoners. These prisoners were subsequently thrown into a quarry outside Syracuse, a grim reminder of the brutal consequences of war. Lennon\u2019s novel, *Glorious Exploits*, draws inspiration from this historical event, blending elements of comedy and tragedy to create a unique narrative that bridges the gap between ancient and modern worlds. Through the lens of two potters, Lennon explores themes of resilience, creativity, and the human spirit in the face of adversity. The novel\u2019s setting in ancient Sicily, combined with its modern-day Dubliner protagonists, offers a fresh perspective on a well-known historical event, making it a compelling read for both history enthusiasts and fiction lovers alike.
