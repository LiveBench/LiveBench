However, frustration and disappointment soon set in as many were kicked off booking websites. The band's brothers, Noel and Liam Gallagher, had a famously fiery relationship, and their refusal to speak to each other for long periods after splitting up in 2009 may have contributed to the drama surrounding the reunion. The star of the day was Error 503, the message received by some after they thought they had reached the front of the queue. Some of those who did manage to select tickets for gigs in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Dublin, London, and Manchester found that the cost had risen unexpectedly, thanks to a policy of dynamic pricing. The web portals of Ticketmaster, Gigs and Tours, and See Tickets all struggled with demand, prompting flurries of social media posts from fans, politicians, and celebrities. Dan Walker, the Channel 5 newsreader and former Strictly Come Dancing star, pleaded for a fairer, simpler, and more efficient way of selling tickets that wasn't so open to touts, scammers, resellers, and bots."}

Our beliefs are the engines of history, and the genesis of those beliefs can be traced to the great prophets, theologians and philosophers whose visions have held us in their thrall for more than 2,500 years. The history of war shows with terrifying clarity the extent to which those beliefs\u2013 no matter how irrational, fantastic or plain groundless \u2013 periodically gripped the collective mind and hurled us into conflict, revolution and chaos, and how we\u2019ve always been willing to slaughter each other in great numbers in the name of those beliefs. Sapiens first started carving axes and fashioning spears and killing one another some 70,000-80,000 years ago, in southern Africa. The idea of peaceful cooperation was alien to those warring tribes.

Premiering in competition at the Venice film festival, true-crime drama The Order is about the most dynamic thing seen on the Lido in the event\u2019s first few days, and affirms Kurzel\u2019s status as a formidable auteur, especially when it comes to the dark stuff. Scripted by Zach Baylin and based on the book The Silent Brotherhood by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, The Order recounts the early 80s hunt for a neo-Nazi militia group: a splinter faction from an extreme-right church, led by fanatics who want to stop praying and put the white supremacist agenda into murderous action. Law, who also produced, plays Terry Husk, the FBI man who arrives in the Pacific northwest to pursue the faction, while carrying scars from his career fighting the KKK and the mob; Tye Sheridan is a local cop who befriends him.

The Observer has learned that the country\u2019s leading charity for older people, Age UK, has written to Reeves with a specific proposal it believes will be fairer and that would prevent around two million pensioners being deprived of a payment it says they badly need. The UK chancellor revealed plans in July to introduce a means test for the winter fuel payment, where only those on pensions credit would qualify, as part of a push to plug what she said was a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances left by the previous Conservative administration. But many Labour MPs have reported being bombarded with complaints from constituents furious at the plan, which was not in Labour\u2019s election manifesto. Last week, on a visit to Scotland, Reeves was told by a group of anxious Labour backbenchers that they did not believe the plans were fair. The issue is likely to be raised by both Labour and Tory MPs when parliament reconvenes after the summer recess on Monday. In a letter to Reeves, Age UK has put forward a detailed plan suggesting that, rather than limiting winter fuel payments to those on pension credit, the allowance should also be paid to two million more pensioners \u2013 those on a range of other benefits including housing benefit, council tax support, attendance allowance and carers\u2019 allowance. Confirming the move, Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \u201cAge UK has written to the chancellor, explaining why we oppose the means-testing of winter fuel payment and asking her to take action to safeguard the estimated two million pensioners who, as things stand, are set to lose it and who will experience severe hardship as a result. \u201cWe think that, if the policy is to be introduced at all, then it shouldn\u2019t happen so quickly, and if it is to happen in the future, the pool of pensioners entitled to winter fuel payment needs to be made far wider.

They took the muzzle off their dog and it went straight up to the slight 10-year-old girl and sniffed her. Terrified, she pleaded to be with her mother, but the soldiers seemed to have just one phrase in accented Arabic: \u201cOpen the doors.\u201d\n\nThe platoon pushed her up to each of the doors in her aunt\u2019s house, according to Malak\u2019s account, while they remained braced behind her ready to fire at whoever might be inside. One door wouldn\u2019t open, and in her desperation to obey, the girl remembers hammering on it with her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I just wanted it to open,\u201d she said on Saturday, accompanied by her parents as she retraced her actions on the first night of the Israeli incursion.\n\nThe door was finally forced open with a rifle butt which left a hole above the handle, but there was no one on the other side and the soldiers moved on. The IDF rejected the allegations of the Shihab family. \u201cSuch events are inconsistent with the IDF\u2019s code of conduct, and according to a preliminary inquiry this story is fabricated and did not occur,\u201d a spokesperson said. Similar allegations were made during an earlier incursion in Nur Shams in April, and were also denied by the army.\n\nThe story of Malak Shihab is a heartbreaking one, as she was subjected to a terrifying ordeal by Israeli soldiers during their incursion into Nur Shams camp. The soldiers\u2019 actions were inconsistent with the IDF\u2019s code of conduct, and the allegations of the Shihab family were denied by the army.

England fancied they had a good \u2019un on their hands, although how good was still to be established. Twelve years on \u2013 a passage of time barely discernible from Root\u2019s boyish looks and sunny disposition \u2013 the going, like the answer to that latter question, was great. Just 48 hours after matching Alastair Cook\u2019s tally of 33 Test centuries for England, Root claimed the record outright, his second of the match lighting up a gloomy third day at Lord\u2019s and putting a series win over Sri Lanka within touching distance. There have been more taxing hundreds among this remarkable haul; days when Root has had to get the shovel out and dig England out of a hole. And it is true that the third innings of a Test match, when a massive lead has already been established and the follow-on eschewed, can often feel short on jeopardy as spectators wait for the final equation to be set and the start of a victory charge with the ball. But as the public filtered out of Lord\u2019s on Saturday evening, England having reduced Sri Lanka to 53 for two in their unlikely pursuit of 483 to level the series, no one was talking down what they had witnessed, other than a fair few grumbles about the bad light that forced the players off at 5.05pm. Two hours earlier Root had delivered an \u2018I was there\u2019 moment for them when, with 98 to his name and a short-ball plan in place, he stepped to leg and cut Lahiru Kumara through the off side for four. Cook was among those looking on from the Lord\u2019s media centre, more than happy to crown Root as \u201cquite simply England\u2019s greatest\u201d. The former opener will soon have to make way as the country\u2019s highest run-scorer in Test cricket, too, with Root, last man out for 103 in a total of 251, needing 96 more to eclipse his 12,472 runs.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Twelve years later, Root's second Test century at Lord's not only matched Alastair Cook's record but also secured England's series win over Sri Lanka.

The New York Times described the book as a 'comic riff on Greek tragedy, with an Irish accent,' while Roddy Doyle called it a tale of 'modern-day Dubliners living among ancient Greeks.' Lennon spoke from his home in Norwich, where he shared the inspiration behind the novel. He has been fascinated by ancient Greece since he was a child, and his interest was piqued when he read Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, a chronicle of the 27-year war between Athens and Sparta that spilled out across the Mediterranean world. Athens launched an unprovoked invasion of Sicily, primarily against Syracuse, the main power, believing that the campaign would be over in a few months and would help them win in Greece. However, the campaign ended in disaster, with thousands of Athenian prisoners being flung into a quarry outside the city of Syracuse. Lennon's novel is a fictionalized account of this historical event, told through the eyes of two jobless potters who find themselves caught up in the conflict. The book is a comic riff on Greek tragedy, with an Irish accent, and explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the human cost of war. Lennon's debut novel is a fascinating and thought-provoking read, and a testament to his talent as a writer. P.P.S. The novel is a fictionalized account of the historical event, but it is based on real events and characters."}
