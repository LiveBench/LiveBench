The new recriminalization law, HB4002, will give those caught with illicit drugs \u2013 including fentanyl, heroin and meth \u2013 the choice to either be charged with possession or treatment, which includes completing a behavioral health program and participating in a \u201cdeflection program\u201d to avoid fines. Personal-use possession would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. It aims to make it easier for police to crack down on drug use in public and introduced harsher penalties for selling drugs near places such as parks. The recriminalization law encourages, but does not mandate, counties to create treatment alternatives to divert people from the criminal justice system and toward addiction and mental health services. Backers of the law say this allows counties to develop programs based on their resources, while opponents say it may create a confusing and inequitable patchwork of policy. \u201cThe criteria is very narrow to meet deflection: no other charges, no warrants, no violent behavior, medically stable,\u201d said Portland police chief Bob Day. If a person meets the requirements for deflection, officers will call the county\u2019s deflection dispatch line to provide basic information, determine eligibility and connect them to a mobile behavioral health outreach team that will have 30 minutes to make contact. \u201cIf the behavioral health people cannot be there within 30 minutes, we\u2019re going to go to jail.

United have had an uneven start to the Premier League, beating Fulham in their first game and losing at Brighton last week. Last season, Ten Hag\u2019s team were unbeaten against Liverpool, drawing home and away in the league and knocking their fiercest rival out of the FA Cup. The latter, 4-3 victory came at home when supporters created a feverish atmosphere. The manager was asked if the fans again need to make it a hot environment for Arne Slot\u2019s side. \u201cI think that\u2019s often the case,\u201d Ten Hag said, \u201cand I\u2019m sure the fans are ready for it and together with us to take the fire to this good challenge. The fans are excited, the team is excited and in togetherness we will go for it.\u201d Two years ago Liverpool were United\u2019s third league opponent at home, Ten Hag\u2019s side beating them 2-1, a win that followed the loss of the first two matches under the Dutchman. When asked then how Liverpool could be beaten after defeats to Brighton and Brentford, Ten Hag gave a pithy answer regarding his players, saying \u201cbecause they can play good football\u201d. In that case, given the ongoing questions about his side\u2019s style, are United better now? \u201cThat is very subjective,\u201d he responded.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Tickets went on sale at 9am and were expected to be snapped up in minutes, but instead many waited in online queues for hours, only to be kicked off booking websites. Just after 7pm, Oasis and Ticketmaster finally announced that tickets had sold out. Perhaps it was inevitable that there would be drama surrounding the Oasis reunion. The band\u2019s brothers, Noel and Liam Gallagher, had a famously fiery relationship, and had refused to speak to each other for long periods after splitting up in 2009. If they\u2019re still keeping score, they will probably, possibly, be pleased to have made a bigger splash than last year\u2019s reunion of their Britpop rivals, Blur. The star of the day was Error 503 \u2013 not a track by cult 90s musician Aphex Twin, but the message received by some after they thought they had reached the front of the queue. Some of those who did manage to select tickets for gigs in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Dublin, London and, of course, Manchester found that the cost had risen unexpectedly \u2013 double in some cases \u2013 thanks to a policy of dynamic pricing. The web portals of Ticketmaster, Gigs and Tours and See Tickets all seemed to struggle with demand, prompting flurries of social media posts from fans, politicians and celebrities.

Three years ago Young and Hahn led a Super Saturday on the track in Tokyo as each won their T38 100m finals, with Hahn both retaining the title she had won in Rio and setting a world record in qualifying. Here, however, she finished sixth, while Young finished fourth and there could be no explaining it away; both were well beaten by athletes recording world record times. The women\u2019s T38 100m was won by Karen Palomeque in a time of 12.26 seconds, taking .12 of a second off Hahn\u2019s previous best. Palomeque\u2019s teammate, Darian Jim\u00e9nez, also finished in third. The British star meanwhile could only record a time of 12.88 and faded visibly after a strong start out of the blocks.

It is a sombre and often difficult watch. The knowledge that it took 30 years for the real culprit to be apprehended casts a long shadow over the storytelling here and leaves this dignified programme with a heavy weight to bear. Nevertheless, it proves itself to be as capable and persuasive as it is harrowing. Each episode focuses on a different character with a fictional name. It opens with \u201cChristine (The Victim)\u201d, who is powerfully played by The Returned\u2019s Alix Poisson. It is 1988 and Christine returns to consciousness on the banks of the Sambre, having been violently assaulted as she waited for an early bus to work. When she is taken to the police station by her sister, the horrors of the attack are compounded by the shocking, if not surprising, errors of the male officers to whom she reports the crime. Christine, still in the early stages of shock, recalls what has happened to her in precise detail. The camera lingers on her for what feels like a very long time, as she carefully answers the crude, insensitive questions of the bullish Capitaine Breton (Pasquale D\u2019Inca).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Now, in The Order, Kurzel turns his attention to American neo-Nazis, and the people who hunt them \u2013 and, in the shape of Jude Law\u2019s profoundly damaged FBI agent, the latter are not the cuddliest characters either. Premiering in competition at the Venice film festival, true-crime drama The Order is about the most dynamic thing seen on the Lido in the event\u2019s first few days, and affirms Kurzel\u2019s status as a formidable auteur, especially when it comes to the dark stuff. Scripted by Zach Baylin and based on the book The Silent Brotherhood by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, The Order recounts the early 80s hunt for a neo-Nazi militia group: a splinter faction from an extreme-right church, led by fanatics who want to stop praying and put the white supremacist agenda into murderous action. Law, who also produced, plays Terry Husk, the FBI man who arrives in the Pacific northwest to pursue the faction, while carrying scars from his career fighting the KKK and the mob; Tye Sheridan is a local cop who befriends him. But the most out-and-out Kurzelian role here is taken by Nicholas Hoult, who was so disturbingly serpentine in the director\u2019s True History of the Kelly Gang. Hoult plays the disarmingly named Bob Mathews, a blue-eyed angelic-faced country boy with a sweet smile, a heart of flint, and a ruthless agenda to establish an all-white promised land, to which end, he masterminds a set of bank robberies intended to finance a militia. The bible for his project is The Turner Diaries, an actual 1978 fiction-cum-tract which, closing titles tell us, has been used as a blueprint for American extreme-right actions right up to 2021\u2019s attack on the Capitol \u2013 although it\u2019s clear long before the film\u2019s end just how germane The Order is as a commentary on today\u2019s American fascism and its history. While highly effective as docudrama, The Order is also briskly compelling as a straight-down-the-line detective thriller, especially in its action sequences. In the hands of editor Nick Fenton, the robbery sequences \u2013 especially a road assault on a Brink\u2019s van \u2013 have a clean, propulsive urgency that recalls that of vintage thriller maestros like Michael Mann, William Friedkin and Sidney Lumet.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The contracts of Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold will all expire next summer, and that creates uncertainty, not only for those players concerned but for Liverpool as a whole. Everything connected to the trio is inevitably filtered through that doubt. When Alexander-Arnold looked miffed after being replaced by Conor Bradley with 18 minutes remaining of last Sunday\u2019s win over Brentford, it was impossible not to wonder whether this was more than the usual frustration of the withdrawn player. Was it a rift? Was this Alexander-Arnold demonstrating his distaste for Arne Slot and making clear his heart no longer lies at Anfield? Slot, it should be said, seemed entirely unconcerned by the incident, the Liverpool manager explaining that he understood that players wanted to play 90 minutes and that Alexander-Arnold had been taken off in both games so far purely to ease his return to action after his exertions with England during the Euros.

The army also accused two campaign workers representing Trump \u2013 who said he was invited to the ceremony by the family of one of the honored soldiers \u2013 of pushing aside an official who told them it was forbidden to take pictures at the graves of military members who had recently died. Harris wrote in a lengthy statement on X that the cemetery \u2013 the resting place of more than 400,000 military veterans and their eligible dependents, dating back to the civil war \u2013 was \u201cnot a place for politics\u201d. She said: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s team chose to film a video there, resulting in an altercation with cemetery staff. Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt.\u201d Meanwhile, Democrats have called for a US army report into an apparent altercation between campaign staff and cemetery officials. In her statement, Harris said: \u201cIf there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans, military families, and service members should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude. \u201cAnd it is my belief that someone who cannot meet this simple, sacred duty should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.\u201d At a rally on Friday, Trump said he only posed for photographs at the invitation of the families \u2013 even though they did not have the authority to approve such pictures. He said in Johnstown, Pennsylvania: \u201cI don\u2019t need publicity. I get a lot of publicity.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

In three innings as stand-in captain he had posted six, six and one, and the run was starting to get embarrassing. Coming in one ball into the day\u2019s penultimate over, he faced just six deliveries before stumps and looked uncomfortable for most of them. The day ended with England 256 ahead, with one wicket down, and Pope returned on Saturday with his team dealing with no pressure from either scoreboard or clock. He could have consolidated, built, produced the kind of score that would silence the naysayers and relaunch his captaincy, demonstrating that he could lead the team on the field \u2013 which he did notably well in Sri Lanka\u2019s first innings \u2013 while retaining the bandwidth to bat with a modicum of success. Instead, as he waited for the start of the 12th over of the day, he watched Sri Lanka spread their field, indicating that they would try to tempt him into an unwise shot against a short ball, and immediately produced an unwise shot against a short ball. Asitha Fernando\u2019s very first bumper was duly dumped into the hands of Prabath Jayasuriya at deep point. It was exasperating, certainly, but there was another way to read it: that this was his finest single moment since taking charge of the team for this series. What Pope needed in this situation was clear: any kind of score, at any kind of speed, that would keep his critics quiet and let him see out the remainder of his three-game captaincy in peace and in credit \u2013 and in doing so position himself as the obvious candidate when England are next in need of a full-time leader. But what his team wanted was something different: runs at decent pace, and for their lead to grow quickly enough to allow them to end their innings in the mid-afternoon, to profit from the best bowling conditions of the match, and to be on the golf course by Monday.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The Observer has learned that the country\u2019s leading charity for older people, Age UK, has written to Reeves with a specific proposal it believes will be fairer and that would prevent around two million pensioners being deprived of a payment it says they badly need. The UK chancellor revealed plans in July to introduce a means test for the winter fuel payment, where only those on pensions credit would qualify, as part of a push to plug what she said was a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances left by the previous Conservative administration. But many Labour MPs have reported being bombarded with complaints from constituents furious at the plan, which was not in Labour\u2019s election manifesto. Last week, on a visit to Scotland, Reeves was told by a group of anxious Labour backbenchers that they did not believe the plans were fair. The issue is likely to be raised by both Labour and Tory MPs when parliament reconvenes after the summer recess on Monday. In a letter to Reeves, Age UK has put forward a detailed plan suggesting that, rather than limiting winter fuel payments to those on pension credit, the allowance should also be paid to two million more pensioners \u2013 those on a range of other benefits including housing benefit, council tax support, attendance allowance and carers\u2019 allowance. Confirming the move, Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \u201cAge UK has written to the chancellor, explaining why we oppose the means-testing of winter fuel payment and asking her to take action to safeguard the estimated two million pensioners who, as things stand, are set to lose it and who will experience severe hardship as a result. \u201cWe think that, if the policy is to be introduced at all, then it shouldn\u2019t happen so quickly, and if it is to happen in the future, the pool of pensioners entitled to winter fuel payment needs to be made far wider. There are different options for how to achieve this, but there\u2019s no time to do any of them \u2013 or to make a big difference to pension credit take-up either \u2013 in the few months left this year.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Be afraid. After falling below peak sharpness at the end of last season, Haaland is back to his awesome best and is making defenders tremble again. Another hat-trick to follow on from last week\u2019s destruction of Ipswich brought the striker to seven goals in his first three games and ensured that City, who lived dangerously at times, maintained their perfect start on an evening when West Ham saw signs that Julen Lopetegui\u2019s attempts to play a more expansive style will bear fruit in the long run. Ultimately West Ham\u2019s calculation was to decide between suffering without the ball for the 90 minutes and the adventure of seeing where having a go at the champions would take them. In opting for the latter, they kept the crowd engaged throughout and had hope of snatching a point before Haaland surged through to kill the contest with a chipped finish in the dying stages. It was worth the gamble. Mohammed Kudus and Tomas Soucek had chances to make it 2-2 during an even second half, although the inevitable cost to West Ham\u2019s lack of caution was the space that Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne and a rejuvenated Jack Grealish had to keep linking with Haaland. Afterwards Pep Guardiola spoke with a satisfied air, not least because City had punished Arsenal\u2019s draw with Brighton earlier in the day. The manager praised West Ham, who contributed to the entertainment levels both through their attacking play and their curious reluctance to have anyone marking Haaland.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The foundation commissioned focus groups for research conducted by Loughborough University as the basis for its study, following recent jumps in use of private healthcare after the Covid pandemic. A record 898,000 people were admitted to private hospitals in 2023, according to figures from the Private Healthcare Information Network. Record numbers are also spending up to \u00a33,200 on having a cataract removed and \u00a315,075 on a new hip as frustration grows at having to wait months or years for an operation on the NHS. The focus groups found people routinely taking the view that they should set aside money for private care. One woman in Sheffield said that a sum of money for private healthcare was necessary because \u201cit is for things that the NHS don\u2019t cover, which is a lot now\u201d.

The former US president said \u201csomeone should not be a criminal in Florida, when this is legal in so many other States\u201d.

Under the proposed amendment, growing marijuana independently would still be illegal, and individuals could possess no more than three ounces for personal use.

In his social media post, Trump called on the state\u2019s lawmakers to implement regulations that would ban the use of marijuana in public spaces \u201cso we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go\u201d.

Less pleasant, however, was the realisation that there was a marketing juggernaut poised to capitalise on my son\u2019s enthusiasm.

The medical student was attempting, for the very first time, the rudiments of performing an abortion. As she inexpertly brought the pincers together on the soft flesh, you might have expected a little yelp of pain from the patient. There was silence. Not because the \u201cpatient\u201d was brave, but because it was a papaya. Mangold was at a special workshop organized by a not-for-profit group whose mission is to make up for the lack of instruction on contraception and abortion at many US medical programs. But it doubled as a lesson in using a no-frills kit of basic instruments that, in the event of the practice becoming illegal in the US, could be stashed and carried discreetly, to perform covert abortions safely. And it so happens that the papaya, with its little fruity neck and a central cavity full of seeds and pulp, is a serviceable approximation of a woman\u2019s cervix and womb for the purposes of basic initiation for a medic in training. Mangold was in a roomful of 60 rookies from across the country.

Roughly the length of War and Peace, The House of Government aims to capture the rise and fall of Bolshevism through a building and its residents, via a study in eschatology \u2013 the creation of an apocalyptic cult, its unexpected success, and its equally unexpected failure. It is a dizzying book, a hall of mirrors, panoramic and bizarre, as puzzlingly esoteric and thrillingly fervent as the doctrines it describes.

That there is nothing else like it is indisputable. We should begin where the author does not, with the building. Slezkine is best known to non-specialists for The Jewish Century, a lively revisionist history that placed the Soviet Union at the heart of 20th-century Jewish experience, but in the academy he might be better known for his essay The USSR as a Communal Apartment, a pivotal study of Soviet multinationalism through the spatial/architectural metaphor of a crowded, thinly subdivided \u201ckommunalka\u201d flat. The House of Government was another, larger block of flats, completed in 1931, \u201ca place where revolutionaries came home and the revolution came to die\u201d.

The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron\u2019s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week\u2019s climate change summit in Paris, May said: \u201cThere is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.\u201d She described coal as \u201cone of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power\u201d and hailed the \u201cenormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents\u201d. May\u2019s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists \u201ctackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world\u2019s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces\u201d. At the summit she will announce a \u00a3140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus \u00a315m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May\u2019s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

This time, however, could be different. Talk of the total defeat of Isis may be premature, but there is no doubt that Russian air power, combined with Syrian forces and Iran-backed Shia militias on the ground, has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long Syrian civil war. President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of defeat when Russia entered the conflict in 2015. With sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists, Moscow has helped Assad win back control of much of the country.

The US president refused in October to continue to certify the 2015 multilateral agreement under which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump said that either Congress or US allies should fix the \u201cserious flaws\u201d in the deal, or he would \u201cterminate it. The Senate has since opted out of dealing with the matter, and Washington\u2019s allies have insisted that the 2015 agreement cannot be renegotiated. If Trump refuses to sign a six-monthly presidential waiver due on 15 January, nuclear-related sanctions against Iran will no longer be suspended and the US will be in violation of agreement. The other signatories, including the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, would then have to decide whether to try to carry on without the US or allow the agreement to collapse. Either way, the Trump administration would have taken a very significant step toward open confrontation.

Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters \u2013 and, indeed, all clothing except a hat \u2013 to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the \u201cmost disgusting programme ever shown\u201d on British TV. But, while he should be remembered for the work he did with his jolly jumpers on, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for Chegwin, even in his most desperate televisual enterprises. This was due to a natural likability. Only the most sympathetic TV presenters earn nicknames from viewers, and, just as Bruce Forsyth transmuted into \u201cBrucie\u201d, Chegwin rapidly and indelibly became \u201cCheggers\u201d. That identity was cemented by the title of the third huge success of his children\u2019s career: the music-based gameshow, Cheggers Plays Pop (BBC1, 1978-86), which extended his presenting empire to weekdays. In less prosperous times, though, audiences also admired the impressive and affecting determination with which Cheggers, in the three decades after his Saturday morning career ended, tried to reinvent himself, often against considerable odds. In addition to a common problem for children\u2019s presenters \u2013 becoming too old to maintain the required fantasy-sibling dynamic \u2013 Chegwin suffered health problems, including alcoholism. Apart from the established presenter-rehab route of reality TV \u2013 appearing on Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity MasterChef \u2013 Chegwin also offered ironic spins on his showbiz rise and fall in 10 projects, including Ricky Gervais\u2019s Extras and Life\u2019s Too Short, and Kill Keith (2011), an improbable comedy-horror Brit film spoof of Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Under the plans, everybody in England would be presumed to be happy to donate their organs on their death, unless they have signed up to a register stating that they do not want that to happen. In practice, however, it is unlikely that organs would be taken against the wishes of the family. The government\u2019s ambition to change the NHS organ donation programme was announced by Theresa May in her Conservative party conference speech in October. Last year, she said, \u201c500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today.\u201d NHS Blood and Transplant\u2019s figures show that 1,100 families in the UK decided not to allow organ donation because they were unsure, or did not know whether their relatives would have wanted to donate an organ or not. \u201cEvery day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important. We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process,\u201d said Hunt. \u201cAs well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation \u2013 it can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.\u201d The consultation will ask three questions: how much say should families have in their deceased relative\u2019s decision to donate their organs?

Yet Bruni surprised her detractors, showing herself to be a talented songwriter and a careful, nuanced singer whose jazzy chansons soon topped the French charts. She has continued to do so, even after the inevitable hiatus to her musical career caused by marrying Nicolas Sarkozy, and spending 2008-12 in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e as France\u2019s first lady. She has spoken of suffering from crippling stage fright, but this still-gamine figure, fronting a four-piece, light-jazz band, exudes preternatural poise. Bruni moves with beatific grace, recalling Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s praise of her as \u201cthis beautiful creature who can wear anything\u201d; her husky whisper could be a parody of a breathy Gallic siren. Her latest album is a set of cover versions sung in English, French Touch, which is a decidedly mixed bag. It largely works because Bruni pours herself into the songs as if in thrall to them: her pitch-perfect, sparse croon through Depeche Mode\u2019s Enjoy the Silence identifies and amplifies the bleak yearning at the song\u2019s core. The quirky arrangements can be eccentric. Bruni\u2019s cod-jazz take on Willie Nelson\u2019s Crazy veers near to lift muzak, while the jaunty noodling her band introduce to Lou Reed\u2019s Perfect Day sounds at odds with the song\u2019s dark soul.

However, the film looks set to face strong opposition from Steven Spielberg\u2019s Pentagon Papers drama The Post and Martin McDonagh\u2019s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, at a Globes ceremony that will provide the entertainment industry with its first major opportunity to respond to the sexual abuse scandal plaguing Hollywood. Two months after the emergence of allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein that would prompt a further torrent of claims against men in the film industry, the nominations exhibited an already changed landscape in Hollywood. As expected none of the Weinstein-produced films eligible for inclusion received nominations, however there were multiple nominations for Ridley Scott\u2019s All the Money in the World, which was forced to replace star Kevin Spacey at short notice, after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and harassment. At the same time, the widely predicted shift towards a more female-focused list of nominees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal did not materialise. Though there were nods for a number of films with female protagonists, including The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, I, Tonya, a biopic of disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding and coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird, there was no room in the nominees for any female directors, while Patty Jenkins\u2019s feminist superhero movie Wonder Woman was snubbed entirely. Leading the way with seven nominations is the Shape of Water, which stars British actor Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner at a governmental research facility who falls in love with a captured sea creature. Both Del Toro and Hawkins have been nominated in the drama category, for best director and best actress respectively, while Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer have received supporting actor and actress nominations. The film has also received best screenplay and score nominations, as well as best picture in the drama category. It is joined in that latter category by 70s-set drama The Post, which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep as Washington Post higher-ups who clash over whether to publish classified documents about the war in Vietnam.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

From her salon at the centre of the cosmopolis, marvellously at one with her books and her learning, she considered, renamed and renewed our relationship with camp, with photography, with illness: a living legend of braininess and cool. Sontag, was not, though, as her editor Benjamin Taylor admits in the introduction to this gathering of stories from across her career, a committed short-story writer. She turned to the form in order to evade what Chekhov called \u201cautobiographophobia\u201d, which Taylor uses to mean the fear of writing and reflecting directly about one\u2019s life. Evading this fear, Sontag clearly found the name \u201cstories\u201d very helpful: half of them are pure autobiography. \u201cPilgrimage\u201d, for example, which opens the volume, is a memoir of Sontag\u2019s youth in southern California, and an account of her visit with a boyfriend to the home of an ageing Thomas Mann. The only reason why this did not become an essay, it seems, is that the encounter was dull and disappointing, and so difficult to reflect on: Mann had \u201conly sententious formulas to deliver. And I uttered nothing but tongue-tied simplicities, though I was full of complex feeling. We were neither of us at our best.\u201d The next piece, \u201cProject for a Trip to China\u201d, is also memoir: we learn more about Sontag\u2019s childhood (she was a voracious reader and dug deep holes in the garden to sit in); about her habit of ordering ambitiously in restaurants (hundred-year-old eggs); and a little about her father, who worked in China. The piece is more experimental, using lists and tables, characters identified by initials only, and lots of negatives (she does not, predictably, go to China).\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

There are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one, so if you take away not only the meat but the cream, then what\u2019s left? Actually, this year there\u2019s a lot left, as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces, too. With estimates that between 2 and 12% of British people now follow a vegetarian diet, it\u2019s unsurprising that a vegetarian Christmas is well catered for by shops, but the rise of the \u201cflexitarian\u201d means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now, if it\u2019s an option. It takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it, but with a little effort, there\u2019s now a gluttonous array of choice. Christmas dinner is a roast with bits added on, and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway. There are a few tweaks that may need to be made \u2013 use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat; swap butter for olive oil in the mash, and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots (you could swap in maple or agave syrup for sweetness).

With the return to surplus built on income tax revenue, any income tax cuts are unlikely to come before the next decade without either increases in other taxes or big cuts to government services. Amid the usual \u201cfree markets are great\u201d rah-rah that the prime minister doled out to the Business Council of Australia on Monday night, Malcolm Turnbull also slipped in a line on income tax cuts, noting that he was: \u201cActively working with the treasurer and all my cabinet colleagues to ease the burden on middle-income Australians, while also meeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.\u201d This was a bit of a surprise given the current state of the budget is such that the government is projecting that a return to surplus only in 2020-21and that net debt at that point will total $366bn, or 17.6% of GDP. Even in the best of times, promising income tax cuts as the budget is in deficit is a courageous position to take for a political party that likes to prides itself on \u201cbudget responsibility\u201d.It is even more courageous when the path back to surplus is built on a foundation of income tax revenue. Individual\u2019s income tax has always been the biggest tax in the budget. During the mining-boom years it declined slightly in importance as company tax exploded in value from 3.3% of GDP in 1998-99 to5.3% of GDP in 2005-06. But in the current financial year, individual income tax accounts for just over half of all tax revenue. Now that in itself is a bit of a problem (the IMF and OECD have made calls for Australia to lessen its reliance on income tax) but it is a bigger problem for Turnbull and his call for tax cuts while also \u201cmeeting our commitment to return the budget to surplus.\u201d The issue it that of the extra $88.1bn in tax revenue the government hopes to gain between now and 2020-21, $48.5bn of it is to come from individual income tax. This means that income tax is actually bearing a greater burden of the increase in tax than would be expected. Income tax makes up 50.6% of total tax revenue, but accounts for 55% of the increase in tax revenue between now and 2020-21.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father\u2019s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have \u201cany involvement or association whatsoever\u201d with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than \u201ctraditional\u201d Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead\u2019s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court\u2019s master, Craig Sanderson, said would \u201cnot fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community\u201d. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright\u2019s estate, acting on behalf of Wright\u2019s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later. On Wednesday, the full bench of the Western Australian supreme court set aside Sanderson\u2019s orders, ruling that while Sanderson was correct to say that Mead had been inadequately provided for in the original will: \u201cThe exercise of his discretion to order that provision be made for the respondent in the sum of $25m was flawed.\u201d In a lengthy written judgment, the court found that Sanderson made a number of \u201cmaterial errors\u201d in calculating the size of Mead\u2019s inheritance, saying the focus should have been on what constituted \u201cproper maintenance\u201d and that the initial finding that Mead was \u201chonest\u201d and \u201cnot a gold-digger\u201d were not relevant. \u201cThe capital sum should be sufficient to enable the respondent to purchase a reasonably substantial house with part of the capital sum and to invest the balance so that she will receive a reasonably substantial annuity for the remainder of her life,\u201d the appeal court\u2019s president, Michael Buss, said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Lu Wei was the powerful and flamboyant head of the Cyberspace Administration of China from 2014 until June 2016 and he came to personify China\u2019s model for internet control. He travelled to the United States, meeting with the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon and Apple, and held court when tech titans visited China. Lu was being investigated for \u201cserious disciplinary violations\u201d, a euphemism for graft, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website. He stepped down from running the Cyberspace Administration in 2016, leading to rumours he had fallen out of favour. President Xi Jinping has led a far reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power five years ago and has said graft is the paramount threat to the ruling Communist party. The campaign has seen nearly 1.4m party members punished and Xi vowed to continue rooting out graft during his second five-year term which began last month. Critics say elements of the anti-graft campaign have been used to eliminate Xi\u2019s enemies and root out political factions that oppose him. Lu is the most prominent official to fall since Xi\u2019s second term began and the anti-corruption agency pointed to Lu\u2019s case as a sign the drive will continue. \u201cLu Wei being investigated by the organisation is the best proof of this determination and resolve,\u201d the agency said in a commentary.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats. Labor has consolidated its message to one line \u2013 \u201ca clear choice\u201d \u2013 as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the \u201ccuts and chaos\u201d under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said he is willing to work with One Nation in the event of a hung parliament. But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson. Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller\u2019s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a \u201ccommon decency\u201d to present a gift for a new baby. But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor\u2019s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson\u2019s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east. \u201cThe real issue here is what is going to happen in three days\u2019 time, on Saturday,\u201d Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: \u201cIt\u2019ll be grim under Tim.\u201d The placement of \u201cgrim\u201d seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics. \u201cThat is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,\u201d she said.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

As the inaugural bird of the year poll launched on Monday, the nation\u2019s celebrities, political leaders and media outlets immediately began their campaigns. The divisive Australian white ibis leapt to a commanding lead and the powerful owl, with the aid of Russian hackers, rose up the ranks. But in a crowded field of diverse native birds, endorsements rang out for nearly all contenders. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, cut his ties to the magpie, currently coming second, and set his sights on the emu (whose image sits above Parliament House), in what must surely be an early election pitch. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, chose the Gang-gang cockatoo, another Canberra icon (\u201cIncredible plumage but it sounds like a rusty door\u201d), while fellow senator Nick McKim picked the wedge-tailed eagle, and Janet Rice, the hooded plover. Scott Ludlam, 2017\u2019s first dual citizen, again displayed divided loyalties. The former senator endorsed the Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo at 3.45pm on Monday, but by 8.30pm, he suddenly declared himself \u201cTeam Bin Chicken\u201d. Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, was asked but did not respond, opening himself up to a string of less-than-flattering replies. But the government\u2019s leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, did tell ABC Radio\u2019s Patricia Karvelas he liked the black-faced spoonbill.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

Philip Hammond is in a \u201cmake or break\u201d position as he delivers the autumn budget today, senior Tories have warned. The chancellor of the exchequer is under pressure from Brexiters to make leaving the EU sound like a good thing, while winning back voters by improving housing affordability, boosting education, increasing NHS funding and easing the public sector pay freeze.

He must raise revenue, but not from taxes.\u201d Hammond\u2019s March budget was overshadowed by a failed attempt to increase national insurance for the self-employed; and this time around, saying on national television that there are no unemployed people in Britain has not helped his cause. \u201cHe\u2019s got a hard job but the way he deals with it makes it harder for himself,\u201d said one Conservative source.
