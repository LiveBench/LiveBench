The New York Times described the book as a 'comic riff on Greek tragedy, with an Irish accent,' while Roddy Doyle called it a tale of 'modern-day Dubliners living among ancient Greeks.' Lennon spoke from his home in Norwich, where he shared the inspiration behind the novel. He has been fascinated by ancient Greece since he was a child, and his interest was piqued when he read Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, a chronicle of the 27-year war between Athens and Sparta that spilled out across the Mediterranean world. Athens launched an unprovoked invasion of Sicily, primarily against Syracuse, the main power, believing that the campaign would be over in a few months and would help them win in Greece. However, the campaign ended in disaster, with thousands of Athenian prisoners being flung into a quarry outside the city of Syracuse. Lennon's novel is a fictionalized account of this historical event, told through the eyes of two jobless potters who find themselves caught up in the conflict. The book is a comic riff on Greek tragedy, with an Irish accent, and explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the human cost of war.

England ended the day 256 ahead, with one wicket down, and Pope returned on Saturday with his team dealing with no pressure from either scoreboard or clock. He could have consolidated, built, produced the kind of score that would silence the naysayers and relaunch his captaincy, demonstrating that he could lead the team on the field while retaining the bandwidth to bat with a modicum of success. Instead, as he waited for the start of the 12th over of the day, he watched Sri Lanka spread their field, indicating that they would try to tempt him into an unwise shot against a short ball, and immediately produced an unwise shot against a short ball. Asitha Fernando's very first bumper was duly dumped into the hands of Prabath Jayasuriya at deep point. It was exasperating, certainly, but there was another way to read it: that this was his finest single moment since taking charge of the team for this series. What Pope needed in this situation was clear: any kind of score, at any kind of speed, that would keep his critics quiet and let him see out the remainder of his three-game captaincy in peace and in credit - and in doing so position himself as the obvious candidate when England are next in need of a full-time leader.
