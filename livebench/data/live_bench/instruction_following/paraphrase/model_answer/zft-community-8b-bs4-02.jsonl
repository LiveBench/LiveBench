This commitment was driven by the recognition of the detrimental effects that reckless financial decisions can have on the economy. The mini-budget introduced by Liz Truss just over two years ago led to market crashes and a significant rise in interest rates, underscoring the importance of stability. Stability is crucial for families to secure their homes, businesses to flourish, and governments to fund essential public services.\n\nShortly after the election, I was informed by officials about the precarious state of the public finances. The audit revealed alarming figures that highlighted the extent of the challenges we faced. The asylum system had an overspend of more than \u00a36.4 billion, including the failed Rwanda policy, which was both unfunded and undisclosed. Similarly, the transport budget had an overspend of \u00a31.6 billion, also unfunded and undisclosed. Most concerning was the series of unfunded commitments made by Conservative ministers without any clear plan for funding.\n\nThese revelations painted a grim picture of the financial landscape we inherited. The lack of transparency and accountability in these areas posed a significant threat to the stability of the economy.

This comes just two days after Trump pledged to mandate health insurance companies or the federal government to cover IVF treatments if he is elected in November. Speaking on MSNBC, Warren argued that Trump is adept at tailoring his rhetoric to suit the preferences of his various constituencies. \u201cSo when he thinks he\u2019s talking to his radical base, he says: how radical do you need for me to be?\u201d Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, remarked on Saturday. \u201cDonald Trump will go there and go further. But when he\u2019s talking to the overwhelming majority of Americans, who very much oppose that radical approach to abortion and IVF, he tries to change his tune, and then is shocked when each side now is starting to call him out on that.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s comments highlight the perceived hypocrisy in Trump\u2019s shifting positions on reproductive rights. The Republican nominee, who has previously been a vocal opponent of IVF, has recently rebranded himself as a strong supporter of the treatment. However, Democrats argue that this shift is merely a strategic move to align with the growing public support for reproductive rights. Similarly, Trump\u2019s stance on abortion rights has been a subject of controversy, with Democrats accusing him of changing his position in response to voter sentiment. On Friday, Trump reversed his earlier support for a Florida ballot measure that would protect abortion rights beyond six weeks, a move that drew backlash from conservative supporters. A day earlier, he had told NBC News that he supported the measure, further illustrating his ability to pivot his positions based on the audience.\n\nThe Republican nominee\u2019s recent comments on IVF have also drawn criticism, particularly from anti-abortion activists. Trump has repeatedly emphasized the importance of providing more time for women to consider their options, stating, \u201cYou need more time than six weeks,\u201d during an interview with NBC News. This stance contrasts with his earlier opposition to IVF, which he has described as a \u201cradical approach\u201d to reproductive rights. Trump\u2019s comments have been met with skepticism, with some accusing him of shifting his position only after recognizing the public\u2019s growing support for reproductive rights. In response, Vice President Kamala Harris issued a statement, saying, \u201cJust made his position on abortion very clear,\u201d underscoring the ongoing debate over Trump\u2019s true intentions on these critical issues.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s positions on IVF and abortion rights reflects the broader political divide on reproductive rights in the United States. As the November election approaches, both candidates are navigating the complex landscape of public opinion, with Trump attempting to appeal to a diverse range of voters. Warren\u2019s criticism highlights the challenges of maintaining consistency in a political climate where positions can be easily adapted to suit different audiences. The debate over IVF and abortion rights is likely to remain a contentious issue in the lead-up to the election, with both parties vying to position themselves as the champions of reproductive freedom.

Set in the ancient city of Sicily, the story revolves around two unemployed potters who decide to co-direct a play performed by Athenian prisoners of war. The *New York Times* has praised the novel as a \"comic riff on Greek tragedy, with an Irish accent,\" while renowned author Roddy Doyle has described it as a tale of \"modern-day Dubliners living among ancient Greeks.\" Lennon shared his thoughts on the novel\u2019s origins during a conversation from his home in Norwich. He revealed that his fascination with ancient Greece began in his childhood, and this interest was further ignited when he read *History of the Peloponnesian War* by Thucydides. This historical account details the 27-year conflict between Athens and Sparta, which had far-reaching consequences across the Mediterranean. Lennon was particularly intrigued by Athens\u2019 unprovoked invasion of Sicily, primarily targeting Syracuse, the dominant power in the region. The Athenians believed the campaign would be swift and would bolster their position in Greece. However, the invasion turned into a catastrophic failure, resulting in the capture of thousands of Athenian prisoners. These prisoners were subsequently thrown into a quarry outside Syracuse, a grim reminder of the brutal consequences of war. Lennon\u2019s novel, *Glorious Exploits*, draws inspiration from this historical event, blending elements of comedy and tragedy to create a unique narrative that bridges the gap between ancient and modern worlds. Through the lens of two potters, Lennon explores themes of resilience, creativity, and the human spirit in the face of adversity. The novel\u2019s setting in ancient Sicily, combined with its modern-day Dubliner protagonists, offers a fresh perspective on a well-known historical event, making it a compelling read for both history enthusiasts and fiction lovers alike. Lennon\u2019s ability to weave together historical fact and imaginative storytelling has earned him critical acclaim, solidifying his place as a promising new voice in contemporary literature.\"\n\nP.P.S.

Now, in *The Order*, Kurzel shifts his focus to American neo-Nazis and the FBI agents tasked with hunting them. The film, which premiered in competition at the Venice Film Festival, is a gripping true-crime drama that solidifies Kurzel's reputation as a master of dark, intense storytelling. Based on the book *The Silent Brotherhood* by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, the film follows the early 1980s hunt for a neo-Nazi militia group, a splinter faction from an extreme-right church. The story centers on FBI agent Terry Husk, played by Jude Law, who arrives in the Pacific Northwest to pursue the group, leaving behind scars from his past battles with the KKK and the mob. Tye Sheridan co-stars as a local cop who forms an unlikely bond with Husk, while Nicholas Hoult delivers a chilling performance as Bob Mathews, a seemingly innocent country boy with a hidden agenda to establish an all-white utopia.\n\n*The Order* is both a compelling docudrama and a fast-paced detective thriller, particularly in its action sequences. The film\u2019s robbery scenes, especially a high-stakes assault on a Brink\u2019s van, are expertly edited by Nick Fenton, creating a sense of urgency and momentum reminiscent of classic thriller directors like Michael Mann, William Friedkin, and Sidney Lumet. The film\u2019s narrative is deeply relevant, as it draws parallels between the neo-Nazi movement of the 1980s and the rise of American fascism in recent years. The closing titles reveal that the book *The Turner Diaries*, which serves as the ideological blueprint for the film\u2019s characters, has been used as a guide for real-world extremist actions, including the 2021 Capitol attack. This connection underscores the film\u2019s timely commentary on the enduring threat of white supremacy and its historical roots.\n\nJustin Kurzel\u2019s *The Order* is a powerful and dynamic exploration of extremism, law enforcement, and the moral complexities of fighting a seemingly insurmountable evil. With its intense performances, sharp direction, and thought-provoking themes, the film stands out as one of the most compelling entries at the Venice Film Festival. It not only reaffirms Kurzel\u2019s status as a formidable auteur but also serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle against hate and violence in America."]}], "tstamp": 1755255641.9861562, "total_output_tokens": 514, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

The Dutchman is set to lead the club in his first season, and Robertson believes that a solid defensive performance will be crucial for Liverpool to mount a serious title challenge. The team has already shown promising signs, having kept clean sheets in their opening two matches. However, the upcoming game against Manchester United is expected to be a tougher test, as the Red Devils are known for their strong attacking prowess. Despite the challenges, Robertson remains optimistic, stating that the team has a good foundation to build upon.\n\nLast season, Liverpool's defense was a significant concern, as they conceded 41 goals in 38 matches, which was seven more than Manchester City, the champions, and 12 more than Arsenal, the runners-up. This defensive weakness ultimately cost them the title race, as they were often punished for conceding too many chances. However, the early signs this season have been encouraging, with the team managing to keep clean sheets in their first two games. Robertson acknowledged the progress made, saying, \"I think in the first two games, you\u2019ve seen that, two clean sheets, which we couldn\u2019t have asked for better.\" He added that the team hopes to maintain this form and limit Manchester United to fewer chances, as well as other teams after the international break.\n\nRobertson also reflected on the defensive struggles of the previous season, noting that even when Liverpool was still in the title race, they were conceding more chances than Arsenal and Manchester City. This inconsistency in defense often led to costly mistakes, which ultimately derailed their title hopes. He warned that if the team continues to concede too many chances, they will face similar setbacks. \"When you look back at last season\u2019s stats, I think even when we were still in the title race, we were conceding more chances probably than Arsenal and Man City. And when you do that, there\u2019s going to be a game where you get punished. And that\u2019s what ended up happening to us,\" he said. Robertson's comments highlight the need for the team to address their defensive vulnerabilities to ensure a successful campaign under Slot's leadership.\n\nP.S. The upcoming match against Manchester United will be a critical test for Liverpool's defense, as the team looks to build on their early-season success.

Reeves announced in July that only those on pensions credit would qualify for the winter fuel payment, aiming to address a \u00a322bn deficit in public finances. However, many Labour MPs have received complaints from constituents who are upset about the plan, which was not part of Labour's election manifesto. During a visit to Scotland, Reeves was told by Labour backbenchers that the plans were unfair. The issue is expected to be raised by MPs when parliament reconvenes after the summer recess. Age UK has suggested that the allowance should also be paid to two million more pensioners, including those on benefits like housing benefit, council tax support, attendance allowance, and carers' allowance. Age UK's director, Caroline Abrahams, stated that the charity opposes the means-testing of winter fuel payments and has asked Reeves to take action to protect the estimated two million pensioners who would lose the payment and face severe hardship.

Despite government guidance aimed at reducing these costs, the analysis reveals that parents who are required by state schools to purchase clothing with official school logos are still paying significantly more for blazers, jumpers, ties, and sports gear. Labour has pledged in its manifesto to \"bring down the cost of school by limiting the number of branded items of uniform and PE kit that schools can require.\" The schoolwear industry claims it has made efforts to work with schools to cut costs, but as children in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland prepare to return to classes this week, it argues that further restrictions would be counterproductive. For instance, a sports polo top for ages 9-11 with a school badge typically costs about \u00a311, while unbranded polo tops can be purchased for \u00a39 at M&S and \u00a35 at Asda. A small secondary school blazer with a logo usually costs around \u00a335, whereas a small senior boys\u2019 school blazer is available for \u00a326 at M&S and \u00a316 at Asda. Statutory guidance published in 2021 mandates that schools \"keep the use of branded items to a minimum\" and ensure their uniform supplier arrangements prioritize value for money. However, some schools still insist that parents buy as many as five branded items, which can include sports socks. Many parents report that there has been no significant change in uniform requirements since the guidance was introduced. The government has been urged to take further action to address the issue, as the high costs of branded uniforms continue to burden families. The schoolwear industry, while acknowledging the need for cost reduction, warns that overly restrictive measures could harm the industry and potentially lead to a decline in the quality of school uniforms.

The history of war reveals with stark clarity how these beliefs\u2014no matter how irrational, fantastical, or unfounded\u2014have periodically seized the collective mind, propelling us into conflict, revolution, and chaos, and how we have consistently been willing to slaughter each other in the name of those beliefs. Sapiens began crafting axes and spears and engaging in warfare around 70,000-80,000 years ago in southern Africa. The concept of peaceful cooperation was foreign to those warring tribes.

To have two is a matter of chance. But to have three key players in the final year of their contracts? That starts to feel like a lack of foresight. The contracts of Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, and Trent Alexander-Arnold are all set to expire next summer, and that uncertainty casts a shadow over not just the players themselves, but the entire Liverpool team. Everything related to the trio is inevitably viewed through the lens of this doubt. When Alexander-Arnold appeared visibly upset after being substituted for Conor Bradley with 18 minutes left in Liverpool\u2019s win over Brentford last Sunday, it was hard not to wonder if this was more than just the usual frustration of a player who had been taken off. Was it a sign of tension? Was Alexander-Arnold expressing his dissatisfaction with Arne Slot and making it clear that his heart no longer belongs at Anfield? Slot, however, seemed entirely unfazed by the incident. He explained that he understood players\u2019 desire to play the full 90 minutes and that Alexander-Arnold had been substituted in both games so far to ease his return to action after his efforts with England during the Euros. It was probably nothing, but the uncertainty surrounding his contract means that even the smallest things can\u2019t be dismissed as mere coincidence. The same doubt looms over van Dijk and Salah, whose contracts are also set to expire next summer. This uncertainty affects not just the players but the team\u2019s strategy and morale. It\u2019s a situation that could have been avoided with better planning. The trio\u2019s contracts are a ticking time bomb, and the longer they remain unresolved, the more it feels like a sign of carelessness on Liverpool\u2019s part. The club\u2019s management must address this issue before it becomes a bigger problem. The uncertainty surrounding the trio\u2019s futures is a distraction that could cost Liverpool dearly. The players are understandably frustrated, and the team\u2019s performance has suffered as a result. It\u2019s time for Liverpool to take action and secure the future of these key players.

A new law, HB4002, will reinstate penalties for drug possession, offering individuals the option to face charges or participate in treatment programs. These programs include completing a behavioral health program and engaging in a \"deflection program\" to avoid fines. Possession of personal-use drugs will be classified as a misdemeanor, carrying a maximum penalty of six months in jail. The law also aims to increase police enforcement of drug use in public spaces and impose stricter penalties for drug sales near areas like parks. It encourages, though does not require, counties to develop treatment alternatives to divert individuals from the criminal justice system and toward addiction and mental health services. Supporters argue this allows for tailored programs based on local resources, while critics warn it could lead to inconsistent and unfair policies. Portland Police Chief Bob Day explained that deflection eligibility is limited to those with no other charges, no warrants, no violent behavior, and who are medically stable. If eligible, officers will contact a county\u2019s deflection dispatch line to connect individuals with a mobile behavioral health outreach team within 30 minutes. If the team cannot reach the individual in time, they will be taken to jail. Day emphasized the urgency of the process, stating, \"We\u2019re not able to just wait around.\" ***\n\nThe new law marks a significant shift in Oregon's drug policy, moving away from decriminalization to a more punitive approach. While it aims to address public safety concerns, it also raises questions about the effectiveness of treatment programs and the potential for increased incarceration. The deflection program, designed to divert individuals from the criminal justice system, may face challenges in implementation, particularly in ensuring timely access to behavioral health services. Critics argue that the law could create a patchwork of policies across counties, leading to inequities in how individuals are treated. Supporters, however, believe it provides a necessary framework for addressing drug use and addiction through a combination of enforcement and treatment. The law\u2019s impact on public health and criminal justice outcomes will likely be closely monitored in the coming years. ***\n\nThe expiration of Oregon\u2019s drug decriminalization experiment highlights the ongoing debate over the best approach to addressing drug use and addiction. While decriminalization was seen as a progressive step toward reducing stigma and encouraging treatment, the new law reflects a return to traditional punitive measures. The deflection program, which offers an alternative to incarceration, is a key component of the law, but its success will depend on the availability and effectiveness of behavioral health services. The law also introduces stricter penalties for drug sales near public spaces, aiming to reduce drug-related harm in these areas. However, critics argue that the law may disproportionately affect marginalized communities and fail to address the root causes of drug use. The law\u2019s implementation will be closely watched, as it could set a precedent for other states considering similar policies. ***\n\nIn conclusion, the new law in Oregon represents a significant change in the state\u2019s approach to drug policy, shifting from decriminalization to a more punitive framework. While it aims to enhance public safety and provide treatment alternatives, it also raises concerns about the potential for increased incarceration and inequities in implementation. The deflection program, designed to divert individuals from the criminal justice system, will be a critical factor in determining the law\u2019s success. As Oregon moves forward with this new approach, the broader implications for drug policy and public health will be closely examined. ***\n\nP.P.S: The law\u2019s impact on the **age** of individuals involved in drug-related offenses, the **country**\u2019s overall drug policy landscape, the **shopping** habits of those seeking treatment, and the **tongue** of public discourse on drug use will all be important considerations in the coming years."]}], "tstamp": 1755255774.011175, "total_output_tokens": 779, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}

Matthew, who had been struggling with a gambling problem that started with online gaming years ago, was in tears and revealed his mounting financial troubles. Earlier that evening, Matthew had confided in another family member, who only made him feel worse by calling him an idiot. Vincent stayed on the phone with Matthew as he drove to find him, reassuring him that the only thing they couldn't solve was jumping off a cliff. They ended up at a local Chinese restaurant, where they spent three hours discussing Matthew's feelings. Vincent had known Matthew played online games but was unaware that it had escalated into online gambling. Two years later, Matthew is still repaying his debts, and Vincent has avoided asking for details, as he still feels ashamed. Vincent understands that Matthew's gambling began when he started purchasing 'power packs' for in-game characters using the budget Vincent had given him on his PayPal account. Despite working part-time, Matthew managed to get a credit card and bought more game packs, selling them for a profit. The excitement of taking risks and moving money around in transactions for potential gains eventually led him to other forms of gambling.\"\n}\n```"]}], "tstamp": 1755255807.0734098, "total_output_tokens": 279, "api_info": {"provider": "http://localhost:8000/v1", "api_name": "/dev/shm/ai-model/ZFT-Community-8B-BS4-20250813", "api_kwargs": null}}
